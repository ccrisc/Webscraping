It does its job and the battery logo on top right is handy you push it and it shows how much battery it has left mines came sorta charged with three blue LED lights on works when I charge the battery also fits right in my pocket I would recommend this its pretty good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XIBJKG" id="B003XIBJKG-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-24:</strong> So I've had this product for a month now. The issue I have with it is its not made by Apple, thus the specs on the power port aren't exact. About two weeks after using it (I use it on airplanes to charge my phone when power isn't available), I noticed all the plug into the power port of my iPhone were lose. I took the phone into the Apple store and they replaced it, and said avoid this accessory, as they tend to bend the ports in the phone.I like the idea, but my phone is a $900 phone... not about to ruin another phone just to have a cheap charger.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XIBJKG" id="B003XIBJKG-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-25:</strong> I was looking for a portable power adapter for my iPod. This was inexpensive. It works great. It doubles the battery life of my iPod. Great for when I'm out and need to charge the iPod. Buy multiples- your friends and family will want one.

No packaging, no instructions, no removable plastic cover. Nothing but the device in a plastic bag. I thought I would receive this item in manufacturer's packaging since this is how I received another one from another Amazon vendor. I wanted to give these as gifts but can't in this packaging.

They have been used to charge my iPhone 4 and one charge (from 20% to 100%) just about exhausts the capacity. Best features are small size and built-in iPhone 4s and earlier connector -- will not work with iPhone 5 and beyond.  For this price, there cannot be much quality control and while mine were both good, it should not be surprising if you have to exchange a DOA. I would recommend buying two or more and returning the DOAs. If you expect more than this from a five dollar charger, you are living on the wrong planet. Much larger and more expensive chargers sold on Amazon have as much as five time the capacity and will also charge iPads. I purchased one by Jackery for that purpose and it works quite well. It does, however, require a not-included connector cable that is compatible with your device so that it will work with iPhone 5 as well as other smart phones, but not as convenient for iPhone 4 use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XIBJKG" id="B003XIBJKG-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> Gives my iphone a battery boost Seems to last for a few hours and takes a few hours to load to capacityThe question is the durability and life of this battery.

I got a pouch of what I can only assume to be instant chinese coffee.  No big deal, since I dod not purchase the case for the free gift.I have been wearing this case on my belt for about a month now, the leather has held up just fine.  No stiches are falling out or anything else that might be a sign of a cheap case.  It has the clip on loop, as well as the slide on loop for a more secure option.  It has magnetic closures that work just fine, and the holes almost line up to enable you to use the headphones while the phone is in the case.There have been a few times where the phone was unlocked while in the case, but the trick is to watch where you are touching the phone when you push it into the case.Good fit, good quality, good price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0050LW42Q" id="B0050LW42Q-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-13:</strong> As someone who's now bought several leather or leather-like horizontal cases around here for both his old Samsung Captivate, and his new Samsung Infuse, here's the straight skinny on this case...It handles the length of the Infuse quite nicely, but it's clearly made for both a slightly wider and thicker phone.  One commenter, here, says the phone "rattles around" in the case; I don't know if I'd go that far, but it's definitely for a slightly wider and thicker phone; though the length part is at least closer to being right.  But, bottom line, it's close enough to right in all dimensions that it's just not worth complaining about.  And as I'll explain further down herein, there's actually a good potential use for that extra room!As for the overall quality issues that others talk about, here, yes, it's true, that this case does not compare with one of the thirty dollar ones.  Obviously, those are better.  For example, the Rocketfish brand one I got for my old Samsung Captivate, for which I paid pushing fifty bucks at BestBuy (er... or... wait... maybe the MSRP was fifty, and I paid thirty... ugh... I can't remember now), was superior in just about every way... including, and especially, its cool swivel belt clip, and its lack of the annoying additional belt loops on either side thereof, which this one irritatingly has.But I've got both this case, and that Rocketfish sitting on the table in front of me right now, as I type this, and the truth is that the softness of the inside of both cases is about the same; the magnets are about the same; and even though this case is made of... well... I'm not sure it's actually leather... or, if it is, it's pretty bad leather... anyway, even though this case may not be made of the soft, reasonably high-mid- to high-end leather of which the Rocketfish is made, whatever this case is made of (that's close enough to being leather to make most people happy) is perfectly fine.  This one's leather -- or, again, whatever it is that's close enough to leather to not really matter -- is sturdy, wears well, looks nice, its stitching is good, and, all things considered, it's fine.  One most certainly would not be embarrassed to have it on one's belt.  The negative comments, here, about inordinately bad quality, are simply uncalled for.And even though the belt clip in the center of the back of this one doesn't swivel like the one on the Rocketfish, it's still pretty darned strong.  It's definitely not going anywhere.  I realize that some will thread their belts through both the center clip, and the two safety loops on either side -- just to make sure the case never comes loose -- but believe me, it's not going to come loose.  In fact, I'm even contemplating cutting-off the loops... though they're soft enough that they compress down nicely if all one does is use the center clip, so maybe I don't need to cut them off after all.  I'll decide after I've used it more.All things considered, this is a great case... ESPECIALLY for the money.  Frankly, for what this case costs, it could be made of aluminum foil and Scotch tape and it would almost be worth the money.  But, honestly, I can see some retail stores charging up to $15 or maybe even $20 for this one, and, seriously, they could get away with it... the overall quality would support a price like that in a full retail environment.  I kid you not.  Only if one knew how cheap they are around here would such a price feel even remotely like a "rip off."  The case is at least that good; and I wish others would stop posting things around here which mislead readers into suspecting that this case is cheaply made or not worth owning.This case is the same as about a gazillion other cases sold here on Amazon, in all manner of sizes, and for all manner of prices; which cases have either the little "x"-looking metal emblem in the corner of the front cover, or the little anchor-looking emblem, or no emblem at all.  I'm pretty sure they're all made by the same Chinese company, regardless of the brand name they bear, or who sells it.  This particular case is the most common type of them out there... some of which sell for up to $30, even here on Amazon.  So everyone here needs to lighten-up on the quality of this case... especially considering the price.But here's one really important thing:  There are a lot of cases around here (at Amazon) which claim to be for the Infuse, but which, trust me on this, are TOO SMALL.  One that I ordered was even too small for a Samsung Captivate (yet it was labeled as being for the Infuse); and another I got was larger, but still not large enough for the Infuse... in fact, it said, right on its packaging, that it was for the "Google Nexus One" or the "HTC HD2"... both phones not-insignificantly smaller than the Infuse.  With that second one (the one labeled as being for either the "Nexus One" or the "HTC HD2"), the length of the Infuse could be forced into the case, but when the cover was closed it pressed the power button.  Oy.I cannnot BEGIN to tell you how much of that sort of thing is going on around here.  Almost no one around here ships the right sized case -- at least not of this case's type -- when it's for really big phones like the Infuse.  Most of the sellers of these things apparently just don't realize how big is the Infuse......so, trust me on this, it's a blessing when one of them gets it even close to right, as the seller of this case pretty much does.In fact, get this:  This case is not only big enough for the Infuse, but it'll even handle an Infuse that's got a thin TPU case on it... such as, for example, the BodyGlove Mirage...[...]...just to name one.  And that Mirage is the one that most AT&T; stores carried for both the Captivate and the Infuse, so it's a GOOD one!  I highly recommend it.  It sold in AT&T; stores for twenty bucks; and I've seen it for the Infuse for as low as $1.23 around here (though I think the ones at THAT price are now sold out).  So good is the Mirage that if one can get one for from $7 to even $15, it's well worth it!That, for me, was actually what I've been looking for.  I've wanted a horizontal case that's big enough for my Infuse when I have the BodyGlove TPU case on it......and, boy, are cases of this case's type which are THAT big ever hard to find around here!  I can't even IMAGINE what's going to happen when Samsung Galaxy Note...[...]...owners go snooping around here for a case like this that's big enough to accommodate a Note with a TPU case on it!  Yikes!I also have a no-name brand shiny black TPU case that's a tad thicker than the BodyGlove, and this horizontal leather case will even accommodate that (though with slightly more drag going into and coming out of the case than with the slightly thinner BodyGlove).So, I have to say, all things considered, that this is a pretty darned nice little case of its type for the Samsung Infuse owner.  It's by no means top of the line, of course; but it's nowhere NEAR bad enough for people to be posting things around here about it like "you get what you pay for" and some of the other negativity I've seen posted here.  Sometimes I just shake my head in disbelief at the way some people assess things.  Scarier, yet, though, is that people like that end-up on juries and decide people's fates!  But now I digress.  Sorry.I gave this case five stars not because it can compare with the likes of, for example, that Rocketfish I was talking about; but because for a case of this case's price, versus its quality -- and, alas, the fact that it actually FITS an Infuse -- are you KIDDING me?  Of COURSE it's worth five stars!  Gimmee a break, people!And, oh... by the way... don't bother going out and looking for a Rocketfish for the Infuse.  They don't make one... at least not as of this writing.  Don't worry... I already checked!If you're an Infuse owner, and you have no TPU case on it, then, yes, this case might be a tad (and, seriously, only a tad) sloppy... but at least it's big enough (which, in and of itself, is cool, considering how hard it is to find a case that's big enough).But if you have a TPU case on your Samsung Infuse, then this really is the case for you......either that, or, if you want a brown one, then this case...[...]...is also large enough for an Infuse either with or without a TPU case.  In fact, that brown one is a millimeter or so larger on the inside, and so it can handle the shiny no-name TPU case better than can this black one.  But either case will handle the Infuse, with or without either kind of TPU case on it, and so those are my two cases that I now have... this black one for when I need a black case, and the above-linked-to brown one when I need a brown case.  And I'm happy (though, that said, I admit I still wish Rocketfish made one big enough). [grin]Hope that helps!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0050LW42Q" id="B0050LW42Q-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-12-28:</strong> Hi!I got this for my  Samsung Infuse with the extended battery and cover for when I'll be out awhile.

It has a silicone liner and a solid plastic case outside of that.  It all fits as if it had been original equipment that came with the phone.  Very snug. The phone buttons are now activated by pushing the appropriate (marked) place on the silicone, and all work well.You need to protect an expensive phone like this, which is why I originally bought just a silicone cover for it.  However, this made it very difficult to slip in and out of my pocket.  With this new cover, the phone is both protected and there is no pocket problem.My only annoyance, and the reason I did not give this 5 stars, is ironically due to the snug fit which I praised above.  This phone is a battery hog, and when I need to replace the battery with one that is fully charged, the case is somewhat challenging to get on and off.All said, I would buy it again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0051PH9H6" id="B0051PH9H6-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-05:</strong> This has saved my phone on so many occasions!

That said, the holster was great, the protection was awesome and if I worked in Construction or some other rough-and-tumble trade, that would have been the perfect option.So I sent that back and ordered the Commuter Series.  I like it!  Only I am giving it 4 stars because I would have loved it if there were a holster or belt-clip with it.  For some reason, I hate putting my phone in my pocket or purse and prefer to have it somewhere that it is always accessible and this happens to be my belt or hooked on my pocket.  And, this way the phone does not collect dust and "pocket fuzz" (and the Commuter Series does tend to collect it quite well on the silicone cover). But, alas, the holster I purchased (also through Amazon) will not fit the phone with this case on it.That said, the case has a lot of plusses!!!  The bulk (from the Defender Series) is considerably less.  The sides around the display are not high and this makes everything accessible.  The protection is amazing.  I am not a phone dropper but I love to have a nice phone.  The OtterBox Commuter Series, in my opinion is classy and sleek and makes for a professional phone. I do kind of wish it came in other colors (such as royal blue) but I have not found that yet.The self-adhesive screen cover is great.  It comes with a OtterBox installation card (so you don't have to use your credit card - lol!) and when I put it on, following the installation instructions, it was simple and there are no bubbles.  It also comes with a little screen cleaning cloth which is cute.Yes, it does collect finger-prints but I think, in time, as my other self-adhesive screen covers did, this dies down after using it for a while, and believe-you-me, I'd rather have that than a scratched, messed-up screen. (My last screen protector saved me from a serious scratch when I was working on the construction of my house roof, the scratch only made it through the screen-protector and could have been BAD; all the way through the screen).  Also, I use my Friendly Swede styluses (also highly recommended) a lot so this cuts down on the finger prints.The price was great!  The price listed on the box was $34.00 and I believe I got this, with shipping, for around $10.00.  What a bargain!Anyhow, I am looking for a holster that works for this (and will fit my phone with this case) so if anyone knows of something like that, please let me know.Otherwise, I highly recommend this case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0051PH9H6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0051PH9H6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0093IHYRC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0093IHYRC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

But the case does seem to get a little stretched out the more times you put the case on and off but it doesn't bother me. Great case one of my favorites!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHYRC" id="B0093IHYRC-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-10:</strong> The case protects the phone very well while maintaining usability.

There is a lip that around the screen which is nice because the phone can now be set face down on a table with worrying about the screen being scratched.

I liked this case a lot better than the Stowaway, but it was a tough choice between the Stashback. The case itself fits the iphone 5 great! All the buttons match up and the camera is not hindered at all. I liked the matt finish on this Smartflex better than the glossy finish on the Incipio cases. The case does provide as much protection as I need in a case without feeling too bulky (you can even buy leather holsters that fit this case). The Smartflex does just what it claims, it hold 1-3 cards plus a folded up bill without your cards ever falling out, kudos on the design! The cards do slide out easily enough as well. So what's the drawback? Only a personal preference really. I don't like that your cards are viewable on the back of the phone, a little unprofessional if you have your phone sitting out. Having compared this with the Incipio Stashback I really like how that one hides your cards seamlessly, pretty hard to improve on (and the glossy finish is easy to overlook as a minor thing). So if you want to be free of your wallet, I recommend the Incipio Stashback instead, you won't find anything better!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHYRC" id="B0093IHYRC-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-18:</strong> so convenient.  i don't use this as my everyday case, but on shopping trips when i don't want to lug around a purse or wallet, these are perfect.  also, this one for the iphone 5, unlike the one for the iphone 4, is easy to remove.  and that's something for someone like me who changes cases a lot is important</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHYRC" id="B0093IHYRC-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-06:</strong> It's fits the iPhone 5 just fine.

It feels great that I can grab my phone with a few important cards in my case and my keys and be done with it - it's been very practical for school or when I don't want to carry around a bag. I was worried the color of the red case would be off from how it appears online but I was pleasantly surprised to find it's not the muted red I expected (it's not the brightest thing either - I found the color just right.)Overall I am very satisfied. The one thing I will say that this case is lacking is more of a grip to it. I also have a Candyshell Grip case for my phone and I love how secure my phone feels in my hands with that case on it - I don't get that so much with this case but that's something I knew before purchasing this case. The case also isn't as snug to the phone as I woud like it to be, but it's not too loose to the point where I'm scared my phone will pop up and the sturdy material it's made up of makes makes up for the fact that it's a tiny bit loose.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHYRC" id="B0093IHYRC-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-13:</strong> I purchased these for the Wife and I when we're going out dancing or some place where we need little in our pockets.

Probably one of the most durable cases I've had. It definitely adds some thickness to the phone as well as quite a bit of weight, but for the added protection it's worth it. For those that have always kept their precious iPhone(s) in a case, this won't be new to you. I had an iPhone 5 from release and kept it without a case. Overtime it suffered from some nicks and eventually paint on the sides began to wear off (must be some sort of Apple defect). When I had to take the phone in to get the camera looked at, it was replaced. Right away I decided a good case is a must.The case isn't only very well constructed but also serves it's purpose well as a wallet for your credit cards and money. Cards/money seat well into the case and don't seem like they will ever fall out. I find that I still carry my wallet most of the time due to all the different cards I need but having this case is great when you're going out and only need your ID and credit card.Definitely recommended!

The functionality of the case is great, sure, I love carrying this instead of my wallet but the candy shell was a lot nicer. This case wiggles a little, the phone isn't as snug as it could be in the case. This case will hold me over until I can get my hands on a book book case by twelve south or an incipio stowaway case. Obviously carrying my ID and CCs is very important to me but this is not a very nice case. Definitely not the usual Speck product standard, I think.And another thing, the price is way too high for what it is. I wouldn't mind paying 15-25 bucks depending on the vender. But come on.

It has been nearly a year now, and I can say I hardly use this anymore. The slot for cards is absolutely great. You can really lighten your load by carrying your most important cards with your phone. In college, I dont need to always carry around my wallet to classes anymore, just in case I wanted to stop for something to eat or drink. I could just take my phone, and have my student ID and main credit card with me.And everyone loved it too. I was always asked what this case was and where I got it, it was a hit in social situations.But I ultimately decided against it for everyday use. I got myself a front pocket wallet, and put an InvisiShield on my iphone 5.Why?Well, I realized that the iphones kept getting thinner and thinner, smaller and smaller. They look so sleek and so nice, especially the iphone 5. Getting a card case like this one keeps the phone safe and makes things convenient, but it basically takes a killer feature of the iphone (it's stunning thin-ness) and renders it obsolete. The phone looks like a brick, basically. And I didn't want that.I used the Candy Shell card case with my 4S all the time. From the moment I bought it to the moment I got the 5. But I couldn't keep up with this one as long. I realized that the iphone is so beautifully thin, I just had to go without a case.

But I'm pretty sure it is anyway (counterfeit)The case arrived today, and the power button is hardly pressable, the power button doesn't even click with it when it does turn on the device, it's just like a mushing some potatoes, rather than a click. The issue I have with this is that my wife's power button no longer works due to poorly designed cases that did this same thing.Aside from the power button, the case is extremely loose, I have an iPhone 5s, I don't think there are major size differences between the 5 and 5s because all cases are listed as 5 & 5s other than the ones that cover the fingerprint sensor, but this is the second case that is extremely loose (both from Amazon, though).I for one am entirely done trying to buy cases on Amazon, they're usually crap and the return policies usually have you losing out on shipping costs. Just buy in a retail shop and you can return crap directly and get all of your money back, IMO.To Amazon.com: Take charge of your marketplace and fix the huge quality control and illegal counterfeit problems.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0093IHYRC" id="B0093IHYRC-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-14:</strong> Great durable case, very light, can fit several cards comfortably and securely.

It does slide in & out of pockets easily and does not collect any pocket lint. So far I'm very happy not having to carry a wallet. With this case doubling as my wallet, I better make sure I know where my phone is at all times. LOL. I subtracted 1/2 star due to the lip over the front of the phone. It is raised and you can lay your phone face down without damaging the phone. If the lip of the case wrapped around & hugged the screen more, maybe 1/16&#34; more, I'd be very happy.

They work very well. I wear glasses and hate to look at clear screens with the glare coming back to my eyes all the time so I always buy anti-glare protectors for my phones, computers, etc., anything with a screen. These premium protectors feel like two of a regular protector, very thick and protective. I like that and along with the anti-glare these protectors work fine for me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HT3Q50" id="B005HT3Q50-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-28:</strong> Excellent screen protector. I found this easy to apply once you get used to peeling off the front, pasting it carefully on to avoid air-bubbles, and then peeling off the back to get a good fit. I've seen at the counters in the center of malls, the guys who sell these and apply them on the spot.

Since I can't tell which type I'm reviewing, I will review both types.For the ANTI-GLARE screen protectors, the rating is A-plus. In my opinion, Anti-glare is an absolute necessity and the only way to go! And an added plus for fingerprint resistant!The "clear" protectors have glare and fingerprint/smudging issues that are pretty bad. I quickly became very dissatisfied with that type. It was virtually impossible to read the screen outside, and unless you clean the screen with every use, your phone will constantly look yukky.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005HT3Q50" id="B005HT3Q50-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-20:</strong> Great purchase.

I do clean my phone pretty often with a dab of water on my finger and my shirt usually but sometimes a clorox wipe or something, and my phone still looks brand new (white).The anti-glare is my favorite part and works well, it's allot harder for finger prints to show up too.Overall this set of protectors has been great for me and &#34;CitiGeeks&#34; -Vendor have always done a good job.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B005HT3Q50', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B005HT3Q50', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B003URKXZW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B003URKXZW</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The case is typical Otterbox. Well built, maximum protection for your Phone. But I have broken 2 Holster belt clips. The phone snaps into clip and is held by a plastic clip that snaps into place as you push your phone in, To take it out requires carefully pushing out and with thumb putting upward pressure on the clip. It just cant take it. No matter how careful I've been the clip eventually gives into the stress put on it and snaps. Otterbox should redesign this holster w/ some other style e.g. sliding it in  with enough pressure to hold phone. Use  no stress points. I would love for them to respond to this issue as it is the biggest complaint according to all the reviews I've seen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BU3I5K8" id="B00BU3I5K8-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-20:</strong> This was for my husand new phone and i wanted it to keep it safe .he seen to like it .</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BU3I5K8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BU3I5K8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B002HJBM04</h2>    <p class="price"> $B002HJBM04</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It is possible to get chargers at a lower price, but for now I would go with these. I've found that typically the cheaper ones stop working over several months due to poor connections. While most last longer, I recently got a set of five inexpensive ones for my family from a source other than Amazon and the three which received any meaningful amount of use stopped working within a couple of months.It is too soon to be certain that these Samsung chargers will last longer but I thought it was worth paying an extra $1 to $2 for a name brand one in the hopes that they are better made. Another plus is that the cord is significantly longer on these chargers than on non-branded ones I've purchased from several sources.As these are so inexpensive I do generally buy more than needed so there are always some on hand if one should stop working, and I always have extra with me while traveling. Hopefully there will be less need to have extra with these chargers than with the no-name charges I've often purchased.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002HJBM04" id="B002HJBM04-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-11:</strong> I have ordered about 4 of these chargers so far, because they are great!

It just a little more than twice the size of the small square wall adapter that comes with Apple devices. If you put two of the tiny square wall plugs together, you get the size of this Bolse Dual USB wall adapter. It's even the same depth as the Apple adapters.The metal prongs that plug into the wall outlet can fold into the adapter, for an even more compact shape while not in use. This is a handy feature for use when traveling, so that the prongs don't get bent out of shape in your luggage. There are two USB ports on it, and while one is meant for larger devices like tablets, my iPad Mini charges fine from either port. There is a small blue LED light that glows to let you know when it's plugged in and is powered. It's available in both white and black colors, so you can even get one to match the color of your devices.This charging adapter's compact size makes it great for travel, and dual USB ports lets you charge more than one device at a time. It works not only with my Apple devices, but also my daughter's Kindle Fire, my husband's Casio non-smartphone (that has a USB charging cable) and works with my son's Sony PSP. Anything you need to charge with a USB changing cable, this adapter can handle.A sample product was provided for reviewing purposes.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00COQL9QM" id="B00COQL9QM-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-17:</strong> Bolse dual usb port wall charger gives the user a standard port (one amp) and a more powerful output (two amps) for charging devices.The build is solid.

Hotels, in particular, are stingy with open outlets.  This Bolse high output charger solves part of this problem by having two USB ports, a 1.0 A port and a 2.1 A port for more power-hungry devices.  This means that I can charge my iPhone and my iPad out of the same outlet plug and at the same time.  Because the plug is not polarized, I can plug in one of these with the ports pointing down and another with them pointing up to enable charging four devices out of a standard two-plug outlet: iPhone, iPad, camera, and Kindle, for example.The prongs fold into the body for a sleek travel shape; however, the moveable prongs also mean that sometimes I fold the prongs into the body when I'm trying to plug them into an outlet.  Not a big deal for me.  The body is a glossy white or a glossy black plastic and feels extremely sturdy.  It handles 100-240 volts AC current, so it can be used in many different countries as long as I have a travel adapter. (No power converter necessary, only the adapter.)  A blue light illuminates when power is flowing through the charger so I can tell easily if I haven't plugged it in all the way, something that's extremely important when I'm also using an international adapter.  The charger measures 2 6/8" long by 1 1/4" wide by 1 1/4" deep (without prongs extended), making it extremely portable.This device is a must-have for frequent travelers like me; however, it is also useful in the home or to take to the office.

This Bolse Dual USB Wll/Travel/AC Charger is one of those.  I was actually looking for one the other day to charge a battery pack that needed one and claimed it wasn't included.  This is a very reasonably priced charger and is perfect to keep in a suitcase or glove compartment.  One nice thing is that the prongs on the plug can be turned down and lay flush with the unit.  The box it came is an excellent case so to speak, but even putting it in a Ziplock bag will keep the ports from collecting any debris.The dual port makes it easy to charge two devices at the same time if you have to.  I also like the fact that the small LED light on the face lets me know it's properly charging.  This is definitely a versatile, functional product that is well worth investing in, especially if you travel frequently.

My cellphone normally takes 4 hours to charge using the stock charger. I was surprised by the rating of the charger, which is actually 5V/3100mA splitted in 2 slots. The top slot is rated at 2.1A and the lower one is rated ad 1.0A. the top one can be used to charge a tablet or as a "quick-charge" for any smartphone. The lower port can be used as a replacement to a stock charger due to the rating (1A). As a design plus, it has contacts that can be hidden once finished charging.Now, speaking of performance I was able to charge my Nexus 4 smartphone in 2 hours and 32 minutes. Using the stock charger it normally takes 4 hours and 14 minutes, as you can see on a picture I added to the product page. This time was accomplished by using the upper port (2.1A), while at the same time charging a Tom Tom GPS unit using the lower port (1A).Wraping up, the upper port is rated 0.1A higher than the stock Galaxy Tab 2 charger which I also own (2.1A vs 2.0). I was not able to notice an extreme difference in charging time, but this Bolse unit adds the flexibility to charge my Galaxy Tab at the same time with another equipment.This product was provided in exchange of an unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00COQL9QM" id="B00COQL9QM-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-11:</strong> This compact dual USB charger does a nice job of charging two devices at once using your USB charging cables.

I charged my Kindle Fire HD & my LG Cosmos phone at the same time.I really appreciate the three, over-charging, over-current & over-heating, built-in protections. The flip down AC prongs make this charger much easier to carry around.This charger can be used for traveling too because it has an AC 11-240 150mA 50 - 60 Hz input.  You will need to purchase a plug adapter though. Check the voltagevalet dot com electricity guide to see what type of plug adapter you will need.Amazon's Product Description is very thorough, so I won't repeat it.

It is available in black or white and they are both very sturdy and well-made.The prongs are non-polarized so it can be used in either orientation and they fold back into the body of the charger for convenience when traveling. There is a little notch at the base of each prong that makes it so simple to unfold them--this is a sometimes over-looked feature I really appreciate.The blue LED glows when it it is plugged into a live electrical socket. It doesn't get warm when used to charge small devices like an mp3 player but may get warm with a tablet. It is compatible with most devices that charge through a USB port but there are some it won't work with so check the product description.This charger recognizes the special technical protocols for Apple products and has two ports, one specifically for Apple devices and one for non-Apple devices, clearly labeled 2.1 A and 1.0 A, respectively The USB slots are close together but all of my USB cable heads are slim enough to use both slots at the same time. However, the maximum capacity of 3.1 A is then divided between the two and for some larger devices, charging time will roughly double.The size is compact enough that two chargers can be used in a standard double wall outlet: it measures roughly 2 5/8 in. x 1 3/8 in. x 1 1/4 in. deep.To get the best use from any USB charger, it is important to understand the requirements of each device and its battery. Manufacturers provide this information; Apple's website, for instance, provides a full page of information about each device's battery. iPad batteries should be completely discharged and then fully recharged monthly, while iPod batteries don't need to be cycled. Some electronics should be turned off or put in sleep mode for charging under certain circumstances. It definitely is worth the time to learn about these requirements.A sample was provided for unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00COQL9QM" id="B00COQL9QM-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-11:</strong> Tiny, compact and a simply designed white AC wall charger, this 2-1/8 oz. folding wall plug is a great home or travel accessory (rated to operate at 100 - 240 VAC and 50-60 HZ). When plugged in, a small blue LED light lights up. The two USB ports are 2.1 Amps and 1 Amp. You can charge two electronic devices at the same time such as your iPhone, iPad, iPod, GPS, Tablets, Samsung Galaxy Tab Series, Amazon Kindle Fire, other Kindles, etc. (using the 2.1 Amp port) and also the same devices (at a slower charge rate) using the 1.0 Amp port. Note that this does not charge HP Touch pads, ASUS transformers, Motorola Xoom or Blackberry Playbook.The compact size and the charging range is a real seller for me, particularly since it works overseas. There is also a protective feature that prevents overheating or overcharging. For the price, this is a no-brainer for double charging (wall socket charging is usually faster than USB charging).

There are many chargers around the price range of this, but what sets this apart from the others is that it is extremely small and compact!

There is a 1.0A port for non-Apple products and a 2.1A port for Apple products (other chargers label these ports N/A and A). Using the wrong port won't harm your device, but may result in a slower charging time. The plugs fold in easily for travel, and a blue light goes on when this is plugged in to indicate power.All my other wall USB chargers (three different kinds) have the ports facing out when plugged into an AC outlet. But this charger has the ports on the bottom (right below the blue light in the picture on Amazon). So why does this matter? Here's one example. The last time I stayed in a hotel room, the most convenient outlet had a digital clock plugged into the top opening, leaving only the bottom opening free. With the charger I brought it didn't matter because the ports faced outward whether it was plugged into the top or bottom. But with this charger my ports would have been facing the floor. Just not as convenient. Of course I could have switched the opening where the digital radio was plugged in, but then I would have had to reset it (been there, done that)Everyone's needs are different, so the port location on the bottom may not matter to you, but for me means that this is not a charger that I will bring when I travel. I received this at no cost from the manufacturer in exchange for writing a review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00COQL9QM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00COQL9QM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B002USUKOQ</h2>    <p class="price"> $B002USUKOQ</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The slope of the back starts way to early...This is a great looking design... good for the otterbox cover and any other cover that allows direct contact to the metal around the iDevice... however the plastic clip does make me nervous about the clip just breaking through the hole in the metal.If you have a case of cover that blocks you from seeing the metal around the iDevice charging port[...] then you will need a dock extender to leave the case on. Most cases/bumpers have a small plastic or rubber cover around the charging port that ONLY allows some charging cords to make the connection viable.If your case allows you to see the charging port and around the charging port metal then you should love this charger, otherwise find a dock extender or grind the plastic insert down to allow the connection to be completed.Once you plug the wire into the plastic holder it is blocked on both ends shortening the male end about 1/16 of an inch... so if you have anything blocking the top of the plastic clip from making DIRECT contact with your idevice the male end does not seed deep enough to actually charge the phone... you need a good extender for this to work.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002USUKOQ" id="B002USUKOQ-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-30:</strong> I am very pleased with this dock.

The dock is made of a nice aluminum, just like the iMac. The bought the black one. I am currently using an Otterbox Communter case with my iPhone 4s. Since this dock's connector is so close to the back end and doesn't come up too much, it is impossible to make this work for my case. Now without a case it works perfectly fine. So if you are trying to buy this dock, keep in mind alot of cases simular to the Otterbox Commuter Series case will not work with this docking station. You might want to check out the Konnet iCrado NEO, that one is a better buy in my own opinion.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002USUKOQ" id="B002USUKOQ-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-04:</strong> I purchased the silver unit to go with my new Harmon Kardon Soundsticks.

This  Konnet Dock does exactly that.  The sleek design and great orange color are a bonus to the functionality.I expected this dock to be wobbly, especially side to side, but it is remarkably solid. The phone itself is a bit wobbly side to side while docked, but only noticeable if you grab it or bump it hard - just touching the screen, it stays in place just fine.Docking the phone is not as easy as just dropping it on there, but it is easier than picking up the standard charging cable and attaching it. You just position it properly and push down.The little white non-skid plastic pieces (that go on the back of the bottom) come right off, I don't understand why they're not tighter.  We added a small dab of rubber cement to keep them in place, that did the trick.He has a case by Magpull, it is a hard case but quite slim.  The phone does fit on this dock while in the case.The orange color is not traffic cone orange - it is darker than the picture online appears.  It has a deeper, richer undertone, with a metallic finish.Overall, does what I needed it to, at a decent price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002USUKOQ" id="B002USUKOQ-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-01-21:</strong> Light weight so undocking is a two handed task and it moves around my desk.

When not in use, it's low-profile (and easy to remove and put away) it's easy to install (love the rotate-to-lock thing) and you can position it in any angle you want.I use it for my iPhone to use Waze gps and music/podcasts, etc. i love the thing, I'm buying two just to have in case one breaks.UPDATE: Okay, so if you live in an area that gets HOT in the summertime (e.g. above 80 degrees) then there will be a big problem... the plastic ball and friction-tension mechanism that the arm rotates on is not adjustable or tighen-able, and when it gets hot, the whole thing gets loose and falls down - as in the phone holder portion dips facing down on it's own from it's own weight. What I've been able to do is rotate the phone-clickable portion, and the ball portion in a 'zig zag' formation, and that *sometimes* helps, but it falls face downward on it's own after a few minutes.Second problem that iPhone 4 and 4S owners will experience: normal driving causes the slick gripping foam-rubber areas to slip, and the phone will slide down inside the holder because there is nothing to hold the bottom of the phone - this causes the Volume-Down button to suddenly become pressed, making your tunes/gps directions go silent. My iphone is jailbroken, so i was able to program an Activator action to ignore the volume down button when the dock connector is attached, but short of that, it will interfere with your audio.I can't recommend this for iPhone owners unless you never plan to use it in the summer or if you live in a very cold area year-round.

It even comes with the back cover with the Sprint logo on it.  It certainly has extended my daily use of the phone, but it took a few charge/discharge cycles to really start seeing the full performance.  I am a fairly heavy user of my Galaxy Nexus (phone calls, data usage/WiFi, texting) and I was barely getting 8 hours out of the original battery.  I am routinely seeing 12-16 hours on this battery now with about 10-15% of the battery left at the end of that time.  For the price, it is well worth it.  If you really need longer time out of the device, you will need to go with one of the big, bulky extended after-market batteries.  The benefit of this battery is that it does not add any size to the phone - at least not noticeably.  It is a bit heavier but not enough to matter.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0091V7B9W" id="B0091V7B9W-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> I think these may be older batteries because the lifespan isn't as long as when I get a brand new phone.

I purchased the all-in-one from a different seller and fixed the phone.My advice, be very careful if you purchase this digizter.

Knowing me, I am sure to misplace this stylus sooner or later, so I looked for a spare stylus and came across this set! I did not know this when I ordered, but the larger stylus are the exact same kind that came with my case. I love the colors. I use these for my Galaxy S4 and Ipad with no problem. Sooooooo much easier than using the touchscreen with your finger.The smaller ones are great for On-The-Go! I shared some of these with friends and with my husband. My husband uses it for his Iphone 4s and he also loves the larger stylus. He is not to crazy about the smaller ones and says it makes his fingers cramp. I prefer the large ones too, but I do use the smaller one when I go to the store and have my shopping list on my phone or need to google something or text someone while out. Its just so convenient that you can attach them to the phone and don't have to dig around for the stylus in your purse. I wish I could attach the big stylus the same way.I have been using the first one I had for about 2 weeks and I use it a lot, and I have not had any problems at all. If I ever need another stylus again, which will probably be awhile, I would order this same set again.One thing I noticed was, that it slides a lot smoother and I don't have to tap as hard on my Galaxy than on my Ipad. But I think that is because of the different screen protectors. So if you feel the stylus doesn't move smooth enough, it may not be because of the stylus itself, but due to the screen protector you are using. :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CBX7YVM', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CBX7YVM', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00GO9H6LC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00GO9H6LC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I loved it many times more than the Samsung Galaxy S4 that I had before.  When I saw Verizon had the HTC One Max T6 I decided to give it a try.  Great choice!  I love the phone.  The Finger print scanner works fine for me.  Everything else is pretty much the same as you get on the HTC One M7 but with a larger screen.  I choose this phone over the Samsung Galaxy Note 3.  I'm basically burned out with Samsung phones.  The Touchwiz software is too buggy for my tolerance.  I've had not issues with my HTC One or the HTC One Max.  Excellent choices for a 4G phone with Verizon Wireless.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GO9H6LC" id="B00GO9H6LC-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-05:</strong> Well, I got this phone as a trade-up from the Samsung Note 2 - which was a great phone.  Things I like about this HTC One Maxx better?  The screen is much cleaner on the whites.  If you hold ANY Samsung phone next to an HTC and go to a white background  - say perhaps Google home page - you will notice a BIG difference. Not to say the Samsung doesn't have a great screen 0 it does - but once you see the HTC you will know the difference.Also, I love the front-facing speakers, though I don't think they're really ALL that much better than the Note's - they just face forward and seem a little clesrer.  Still no decent bass.  Though no phone has that.The MAIN thing I like with this phone is the INTERFACE - I love the BlinkFeed!!  It's awesome.  and I like the pull-down toggle dialog for all the common things like WiFi, BT, Screen Auto-Rotate, etc.  Very handy.  The battery lasts a full day with my normal use, but I think the Note 2 was a tiny bit better.  Still testing that, but I have no real complaints there.My only gripe - and it's pretty big - is that the Power is EXACFTLY where my thumb goes to when I pick it up and/or hold it.  IT's maddening that I keep shutting the phone off or turning it on every time I touch it.  Partly due to my cover, which makes it easier to use the buttons - which I like - but I just think the placement is extremely frustrating.  I'm going to search for a different case and maybe that'll help.  Also, the other gripe would be that it is a bit heavy compared to other phones.  Not a deal breaker, though - the screen size and clarity and the interface make the phone the best I've ever had - and I've had a TON of phones.UPDATE 3/13/14:  I got rid of the phone.  LOL  Problem is that it is too big for me, personally, but ONLY when it comes to carrying it around; I loved the screen size.  IT was just a bit impractical.  I don't like wearing holsters and I don't like a phone bulging my pants pocket, so I carry it with me all the time in my hand.  Which caused me to drop the phone once - breaking the screen.  A month later I dropped it again - and then ran over it!  Then two weeks later I dropped it again and lost it.  I managed to find it a few days later, but only after I had bought the LG G2, which is 5.2".  I really liked the LG, and decided to sell the HTC One Maxx.  I miss the screen size quite a bit, but this pohone fits nicely in my pocket, and not so bad in a belt holster.  I also really like the power and volume buttons being on the back of the phone.  I miss Blinkfeed - a lot - but overall, the LG G2 works for me.  I still recommend the HTC One Maxx, if you can handle it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GO9H6LC" id="B00GO9H6LC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-30:</strong> This is a great phone! I had the Galaxy Note 3 but live in a rural area and it got practically zero reception. It also dropped calls and wifi a lot so apparently the antenna's in the Note 3 aren't that great. So I got this phone and LOVE IT. The screen is bigger than the Note 3 and is crystal clear. The front facing speakers are phenomenal and my friends and I can't believe how nice watching Utube videos is. It's really great to be able to finally have a phone with amazing speakers. The camera seems OK so far, very very good low lighting pictures. Phone seems fast and snappy. The build of the phone is a little heavy but I like the solid feeling in hand as opposed to the plastic of the Note 3. Best thing?

They were incredibly caring and helpful and walked us through the whole process on the phone. I will absolutely not hesitate buying all future devices from Amazon as well.

I actually picked up 2 HTC One Max's  (One for myself, one for the wife) after experiencing very poor reception issues with two different Note 3's over a period of 3 months.I didn't think I'd ever like anything as much as the Samsung Note series but the One Max easily meets or exceeds in every aspect other than the S-Pen. I do miss the S-Pen and used it daily. I really wish HTC would have taken the time to add a stylus to this 5.9" masterpiece. Call quality, build quality, cell reception and especially UI are better on the One Max by a sizable margin.The camera on the One Max takes great pictures AFTER you manually adjust some settings. Out of the box pictures struggled next to Note 3 with the Note 3 taking better "auto" shots but after a few adjustments of the Max's exposure, contrast and saturation the pictures are comparable and the features/capabilities are more robust on the Max. The UltraPixel image sensor on the Max lets in 300% more light per pixel compared to the Note 3 making for some seriously good low light shots. The key to taking great pictures on the Max is tapping the screen to focus on the light/dark areas of the shot to compliment the picture and use the increased light sensitivity to your advantage. Like I said the pictures are a little bit more work on the One Max but they are so worth it.Front facing speakers on the Max are about 3x louder than the Note 3 AND crystal clear. Very enjoyable for media consumption and every sound has an HD clarity to it you can't get on the back/down down firing mono speaker found on other phones.Battery life is comparable to the Note 3. Nothing to report there. You should get a full day or more even for the heaviest users.SLCD. At first the Max seemed very flat compared to the Note 3 if you are accustom to AMOLED, but after using the SLCD for a few days you will start to notice that the screen is crystal clear and everything looks almost like a printed picture ,VERY SMOOTH and crystal clear. Its hard to explain the crispness of the screen with words, you really need to see it in person. I quickly noticed the AMOLED looks blown out and not as crisp on the Note 3, especially if you look closely at the pixels. For instance when viewing white pixels on a dark background the AMOLED pixels almost "flare" and I found this to be very offensive to my eyes after a few days of using the Max's SLCD. Where the SLCD really shines is outdoor use or even use with shades on. I always struggled with the AMOLED in those situations but the brightness and clarity of the SLCD blows me away every time I see it outdoors.Size. There is no doubt that the One Max is a huge device. It is noticeably bigger and heavier than the Note 3 but after a couple days I much preferred the heft and feel of the Max in my hand. After that the Note 3 feels surprisingly cheap/plasticky/light and small in the hand which I didn't think was possible. I don't have any problem using the Max with one hand for basic tasks especially if you set a swipe down gesture to expand the notification bar.Anyways after 10 days using both side by side there was no question in my mind the HTC One Max is the better device between the two. You can't really go wrong with the One Max if you are shopping for a new Phablet. The build quality, camera, and especially SenseUI are nothing short of spectacular. If you've never had a Phablet before, the size may be a bit overwhelming at first. Give it a few days and I promise  you'll never want to go back!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GO9H6LC" id="B00GO9H6LC-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-15:</strong> Great for watching TV, videos, listening to music, playing games, etc..... huge phone but my husband loves it great gut gift.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GO9H6LC" id="B00GO9H6LC-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-30:</strong> We finally upgraded from Samsung's Galaxy Note II - one of the best early &#34;phablets&#34;.  Since we really never used the stylus that was included we figured we could go without and get a phone with a good 1080p screen, but also still had a memory card slot since we like to load up media, pictures, and video (sometimes there's still no substitute for local storage - for ex. a long international flight or even a decent long domestic w/no wifi).Though this screen is 5.9&#34; compared to the Note II's 5.3&#34; we didn't think it'd be to unwieldy since we also cross-shopped the Sony Xperia Z Ultra (we'd have switched to AT&T;).  The Xperia Z Ultra is 6.4&#34; and it really feels huge (since it's nearing 7&#34; tablet territory!).We decided to stick with Verizon and ordered these phones.The first thing you'll notice after opening the box is that the phone is quite slim for such a large phone (though the Xperia Z Ultra is thinner), and feels like a solid piece of technology.  The screen is great and the speakers (front-facing) sound great.We swapped our microSIMs (though this comes w/a microSIM installed, we didn't need it) and microSD cards and were off to the initial setup.  HTC Sense is much slicker and less cartoon-y than Samsung's Touchwiz so that was a welcome sight.  I may switch launchers but disabling the Blinkfeed and customizing my layout was enough for now.The fingerprint reader is easy to use and you can enroll 3 fingers and set a backup password in case you... lose your fingers?  =)  I know some review sites have complained about the finicky nature of the fingerprint reader, but I find it works well as long as I start my finger on the camera lens (yes, my OCD makes me clean the lens afterwards) and swipe straight down.The battery is large enough to power the big screen (with adaptive brightness) all day with a few phone calls, browsing, and even a hotspot session or two.  It's 3300mah so that's actually quite a lot compared to most normal-sized phones.The processor is a Qualcomm Snapdragon 600 (1.7 Ghz quad-core) which may not be the fastest (the 800 is), but it's plenty of power.  I've only had the phone for a few days, but it's been great for all tasks (multiple installs, downloads, browsing, etc.).  I'm not a huge phone gamer (I save that for the PC or PS3), but reviews are pretty positive in that regard as well.This has the same &#34;Ultrapixel&#34; camera as the HTC One - though &#34;only&#34; 4 megapixels, they are physically larger and are better than most other phone cameras in terms of low-light sensitivity.  The lower pixel count also allows for faster burst processing for action/multiple shots.  It's only been a few days, but if this doesn't live up to the hype, I'll update.  I prefer shooting using a DSLR or good mirrorless, but the best camera is the one you have on you, so I'm sure this will get some use!So far so good - great phone if you're looking for a large, high-quality screen in a sleek package.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GO9H6LC" id="B00GO9H6LC-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-17:</strong> This is the single most premium feeling and looking phablet out there.  If you spend $600 on a phone and want to feel as though you got your moneys worth than grab this sweet piece of electronics.  The camera is VERY underrated (doesn't produce as many bad/blurry shots as the S4 or Note 3), and there is nothing like ZOE.  I have average size hands and the phone is so ergonomically friendly it is a joy to hold while you game or watch videos.  You may want to get a bluetooth however as holding it up to your ear can  be tiresome after a while, the same can be said for my Note 3.  Definitely worth taking a long look at.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GO9H6LC" id="B00GO9H6LC-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> The biggest thing to note here is the screen size, it's gigantic. Although the clarity of the picture is awesome too.  Everything operates smoothly, and works as expected. It sure is nice to have all that real estate on screen.The casing is aluminum and does have both a premium look and feel.My only real gripe so far is that the volume when I am listening to someone talk is t the loudest.  I do have to struggle a bit to hear.All in all this is a great phone.  If you like a large premium phone and you have pockets large enough for it, pick one up.I came from the 5" galaxy s4.  This one is so much larger, yes, it's big.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00GO9H6LC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00GO9H6LC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00F3YSN5M</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00F3YSN5M</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

If I can use it for a couple of months, and then change it to something else, that is what I was looking for, and I found it.This case arrived in about a week, it fits my Iphone 4 perfectly. The colors are pretty, the flowers have a "floating" effect on the silvery contrast, and it is comfortable to use with easy access to all the buttons. Keep in mind you do get what you pay for, and if you are hard on your phone, this cover is not for you. It will protect it from the occasional drop, this case does seem to "snap" together and feels pretty secure, but it will probably break if dropped repeatedly (that's okay it is less then $4). I like it and gave it 5 stars because it is what I was looking for, a pretty cover that offers the little bit of protection from my keys and change in my purse or pocket. If I had a habit of dropping my phone I would be looking for a bulky OtterBox type of case, which are not as pretty but do offer true protection. Ultimately this case is exactly what I expected it to be. *****</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F3YSN5M" id="B00F3YSN5M-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-12:</strong> Nice soft feel to it.

Look at the placement of your vents.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009D4HHT6" id="B009D4HHT6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-13:</strong> This was a gift for someone else and they said it was a perfect fit for their Note 2 phone.

The mount is on a non level surface, so the phone is pointed downward.  To get the position I wish I could rotate up.  But I am very happy with it as it does what it should, holds the phone and like mentioned before I have a flip case and it works with that so I don't have to remove it from the case which I would never do.Update 1-10-13:OK only good thing I can still say is it holds the Note II....but big deal if it just fails at it's main purpose to mount to a vehicle?  As mentioned above I cleaned and let dry the dashboard and stuck the mounting disk.  This only lasted a couple of weeks as the disk came loose and eventually off, luckily not with the phone in it.Next I tried to use the vent mount.  This didn't work in my Prius since the vents were too close to the steering wheel and the other vents are on the passenger side.  Also phone fell once but I can't say this was not my fault for hooking it properly.  But really couldn't get it to hook on the vent securely so moved on the the windshield mount.Finally this looked like it was going to work.  Felt secure like my old gps units, got a nice safe spot...was happy....for a few weeks.  Then I came out to my car to find the unit fell to off with no phone.  I could not get it to suction again.  A day later I tried again and it seemed to work.  Watched a movie came back and tried to put my phone back in and it came off the windshield.  Luckily it was still in my hand.  I reattached the iKross to the windshield and tested it. OK seemed good.  Put my phone back in and off we went.  2 minutes later the whole thing fell off and on to the floor!! This is dangerous for driving and messed up the phone!  The Note 2 seems to be working OK now but everything got reset.Needless to say I wish I never bought this and have thought about finding an old gps until to modify it since 3 years and never had an issue with it falling off the windshield.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009D4HHT6" id="B009D4HHT6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-26:</strong> It took some time to arrive but overall I've been pleased with it.  It's a bit on the bulky side compared to others but for the price you cant beat it.I use the vent clip and it holds it just fine.  I do wish the knob on the back side which holds it in place were bigger.  When trying to switch from playing music on my Note2 to using the GPS its a bit tricky.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009D4HHT6" id="B009D4HHT6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-11:</strong> I've bought so many vent mounts I have lost count.  They either fall out or they hold in so tight that they break if you try to swap them between vehicles - and even those fall out when you don't want them to; they just won't let go if you want them to.This has a spring loaded hook to hold onto the back of the vent.  I suppose one caution would be to handle any good vent mount carefully when hooked up because you could break a vent - that would be an expensive proposition. I just use two hands (always stopped and in park!) to adjust the phone.  Loosen the locknut, make your adjustments, and tighten.  The locknut tights from the back to the front so it feels backwards when you adjust it from the front while the mount is hooked up in the car.  They should have reverse threaded it so it would feel right from the front.With the spring loaded hook, it attaches easily and reliably to the vent and removes easily and safely. THis is the phone mount I have been looking for for a long time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009D4HHT6" id="B009D4HHT6-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-13:</strong> When I order it I was more than a little skeptical, because the price seemed low, I also thought I would use the dash mount rather than the vent attachment, but after using the vent mount a couple of times I never installed the dash mount. the vent mount is great because in my 2005 Dodge Durango it keeps it at an easy viewing height  with out cluttering up the dash board or interfering with my line of sight.The vent mount works equally well in my wife's Honda CRV and my son's Kia. The vent mount is very easy to clip in and out so it makes taking it in and out to transfer vehicles a snap. The part that actually holds the sell phone is nicely padded and holds my cell phone (galaxy 4) and my Garmin GPS very firmly. I am going to by 3 more for my wife and kids.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009D4HHT6" id="B009D4HHT6-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-16:</strong> I love, love, love this for my Samsung Galaxy Note II.

It holds my HTC One X nice and sturdily without making me nervous of it falling. I've gone over speed bumps at around 20 mph and it still stays on without making noises or anything. I have a Honda Prelude so just in case it doesn't work with your specific car, you can't blame me if my review makes you buy this. I'd say just keep the packaging in case it doesn't work with your car. The other methods of securing the mount to your car also work very well, as they should. It didn't take more than a single try to get them all to work easily.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009D4HHT6" id="B009D4HHT6-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-01:</strong> very easy to set up and good quality for the price , i would recommend this to someone else . thanks</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B009D4HHT6', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B009D4HHT6', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007PLN6KS</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007PLN6KS</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

It doesnt beep like some other pads, being a good thing since your phone from time to time over night may dip under 100% and begin charging again. Being woken up in the middle of the night by a loud beep would not be good. The one issue I have with this pad is that the lights are really bright in the dark. Its not a deal breaker and its not really any brighter than say a night light would  be but for me its something of any annoyance. Other than that I wouldnt hesitate to purchase this product.

They sent me an email before my package even arrived and stated that if I had any questions or concerns to please feel free to contact them. They included both and email address, and a phone number... This particular charging pad is very light, and comes with a micro USB cable, however, it is rather short. It does not come with an A/C cable, but it was not a problem since I have several of these laying around. I just simply used the micro USB cable and adapter that came with my smartphone. I just recently purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4, and have it protected inside an &#34;Otter Box Defender&#34; case. The charging pad works great through the case without any problems. When you plug the charging pad up, a red light will come on to indicate that the power is on. When you lay your phone on top of the pad, a green light will come on to indicate that the phone is being charged wirelessly... On my Samsung, the phone will beep, and a message will appear that says, &#34;the phone has been placed within range, and is now being charged wirelessly&#34;.

My case was teal colored and the camera is set so far into the case that when I try to take pictures all of them are teal tinted because thats all the camera sees.

Imagine telling someone from just 50 years ago that you could have a device with which you could access all the world's knowledge or play games, could help you communicate to nearly anyone in the solar system and take pictures of them with a decent camera that you could share with everyone else in the solar system, could entertain with music, movies, or audiobooks, can track your exact location and speed using GPS while you're beating Kenyans in a street race, and most importantly of all, let you get see the latest from your favorite Internet celebrity cat. Then imagine that you tell him it only takes a couple hours of work to make the money to pay for it.This phone is the phenomenal. Of course, it's not the best phone out there--the iPhone or the Galaxy S4 take the cake on that, but unlike its predecessors (ATT Fusion 1 & 2), it actually works and it works pretty well at that. The storage and memory seem to allow you to do everything that you want to do. You can't store a billion songs on it, but you can store several audiobooks. And the keyboard is infantile compared to the Apple keyboard, but it's not a deal breaker. I dropped it once with no noticeable damage. The battery life is weak and requires charging every other day, but it's a very capable phone besides.I can maintain my Google Voice/Skype/GoPhone system and save hundreds of dollars on my phone bill every year (read my books for more on this dandy) and still accomplish everything I want. It's utter brilliance. Kudos and I look forward to the next generation!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GJY6Y7E" id="B00GJY6Y7E-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-01:</strong> Best Buy has it recently but in AT&T; Stores its not available yet. These phone its from ZTE-USA. Has a 1.4 Dual Core processor  (no lagging or freeze yet) and a decent resolution screen of 480 x 800. Has a 5.0 MP back camera but the pictures in low light are not so good even using the flash. In outdoor the pictures are ok after some adjustments in brightness and exposure. You can change, WB, ISO, Metering in the camera and also include some effects that you can use. It doesn't came with a front camera (sorry girls, no self portraits). Can record 720P video with audio (not impressed). Also took pictures during recording video. It is a 4G and not LTE 4G technology. I get it to replace my Samsung Galaxy S3. I have a 2 year contract and the warranty expire 2 month ago meanwhile so I have 2 choices: (Contact the Insurance and pay double the price of the Z740 Radiant or buy a gophone).I only move my existing microsim from my S3 and have a new phone. Good battery duration. Its has WIFI capability and that is perfect for me and not have to use all my data of my contract plan. I installed a 16GB micro SD and works fine for increase the storage capacity (Only has an internal memory storage of 2GB) so be careful installing to much programs or games from Google.If you want a no contract phone for the price really you will enjoy it. If you looking to get excellent pictures, this its not the phone for you. No cases, extra battery or screen protectors are available yet.**UPDATE** (1/16/2014)Finally I found a replacement battery on Ebay and in Amazon. Its the same for the Avid 4G N9120 or Force N9100.**UPDATE** (3/10/2014)Amazon start to bring covers to the z740.

It was just released in December so it's a very new AT&T Go Phone. The specs are amazing for the price - 4g, 5mp camera with flash, fast processor, android 4.1, good battery life (beats battery life on our iPhone) , and 4&#34; screen. It is actually a ZTE Z740 phone. Call quality is excellent, Wi-Fi reception is similar to my previous iPhone, speaker is good. This is a great android phone for the price and I would highly recommend it. Had a Nokia Lumia 520 and I like this, but AT&T Radiant much better(pictures taken are much better on the Radiant also especially with the flash). The only drawback is that there are no fitted cases yet, but that's only because it is so new.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00GJY6Y7E', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00GJY6Y7E', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004AQLFRW</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004AQLFRW</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I'm not going to go testing how drop resistant it makes my Z1S, but it feels more substantial than many other cases I've seen.To the eye it looks very thin and adds almost no perceptible added weight to your phone -- BUT it still won't work with the Sony magnetic dock, even when using the adapter meant to support cases.I suspect that Sony is being unrealistic, but the bottom line is that I either have to find a new case or not use my magnetic stand to dock the phone when I'm at work.If you do not use a magnetic dock with your Z1S then this is a great case.There is a potential market here for someone - sell a dock *and* a case *together* that are pre-certified to work together.It also includes a screen protector.

It's similar to the wallet case, but much slimmer and the window makes it easy to see the time even when closed. Highly recommend, just don't wipe it down with alcohol (like I do to everything...) or the black will rub off... I just spritz it.

The only complaint is every time I put the phone in the case the inside leather leaves a residue on my phone screen.  while this isn't really a problem the belt loops are not very strong which isn't surprising at this price. When I tried to climb out of a small car the case caught for an instant and one of the belt loops broke. The case still works for what I need and since the clip is very strong I don't think I will notice the missing loop.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S16BU6" id="B008S16BU6-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-12:</strong> I do like this pouch because I don't need a screen protector. One of the things I had a problem with is that my screen protector would get scratch up and dull and that is cause it was in my bag around other items. Well since buying this pouch i took my screen protector off. Obviously the visual looks better without anything covering it, but now when I'm done using my phone i slip it in the pouch and I don't have to worry about anything scratching it or even if I drop it I won't have to worry about scratches or damage. Because of the available picture views I thought it would be a case I could flip open and leave my phone it. Obvious disappointment but still happy with it. I'd say buy it cause it also hooks to your pants or whatever you want it to attach to</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S16BU6" id="B008S16BU6-review33" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-07:</strong> I don't use it much, but was VERY impressed with the price and quality (for the price).

Well, I got what I paid for. The case just barely fit the phone,which I could have dealt with, but after the phone was in the case the magnet flip enclosure would not stay closed. The case just felt cheap which it was since I paid less then $5.00 for it. I actually purchased 3 different cases and found another case worked much better for me. It had a nicer feel,the magnet flip enclosure was much stronger,and it didnt feel as cheap.

They were nice, but that is just too much money for a phone case. When I saw this one and the price I had extremely low expectations but thought I would give it a try.  I'm amazed. It's worth 20 times what I paid. The quality of the construction seems very nice and strong and it appears it will last much longer than I would have expected.Here are the things I like the most:1. It is attractive, it looks much more expensive than it is2. The belt clip is VERY strong3. My Galaxy S-II fits perfectly WITH the rigid skin still on the phone. Finally I don't have to remove the skin to use a belt case!There are two things I would like to see improved on:1. There is no cutout for the speaker, which means the ringer gets muffled when in the case2. Getting the phone out quickly isn't easy. It's really a two-handed operation.This case cost me about the same price as a pack of chewing gum (plus reasonable shipping).I believe these reviews should be about the product, not the vendor, but in this instance I'll make an exception and give kudos to Ur Fun Shop. The case was supposed to take 11 days to ship (which I was okay with), however they had it to me 3 days after I ordered it (and this was not a Prime item). I rarely order non-Prime items so I was very pleased with them exceeding expectations by a full week.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B008S16BU6" id="B008S16BU6-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-20:</strong> Just received my leather pouch and the material is really flimsy, the stiching for the belt is not what it's shown in the pictures, (even these new ones)  it will probably fall apart any time.  The phone fits but if you have the the hard shell cover to protect it, it is an extremely tight fit and if you add the rubber cover that goes on top of the hard shell.....FORGET ABOUT IT !!!! This pouch is only made to fit the phone and the phone only. Thank god it's cheap and I can probably swap it out with some other cover somewhere. I am sure sending it back will cost an arm and a leg. (in the review section some guys said it fit his phone cover and all???? I wonder if he got a different pouch ???. They now have more photos for this product  than I saw before???

Doesn't look cheap at all!  It even smells like leather.  Samsung Galaxy S2 (T-Mobile version) fits nicely in the case. From the side the case is narrow at the bottom and wider at the topThere is elastic on the side crease which is what allows it to hold the phone with a case. So far I am using it without a skin.  However, I do wonder if I put a skin on the phone, will the elastic on the case shrink back well enough for me to go back to carrying the phone "skinless"?  I'll have to update my review and let you know!***UPDATE*****Even with the case, the elastic on the side seam barely stretches.  This makes switching from a "skin" to "skinless" a non issue!

Just slide your iPhone 5 in and snap the corners in place.  It has a rubber like texture and a weave pattern on the back that allows you have a good grip on your phone.  The case fits snugly in place.  It fits so snug that be careful if you use a thicker screen protectors like a mirrored or privacy screen types.  When I slid my iPhone 5 into the case the privacy screen bubbled up on side the case is not open since it was a tight fit.I believe this case is more geared for someone who is into appearances than protection.  I believe this case will not protect my iPhone if I dropped it since my phone will probably just pop right our of it.  I am not going to test it to find out either.  I normally have my iPhone sitting on my desk at work or in my purse, so big bulky cases are not my style.  The Acase Citta along with a screen protector, will protect my iPhone 5 from scratches from my keys, pens and anything else that might be lurking in my purse.Overall, it is a nice stylish case that offers easy access to buttons and features on your iPhone that offers minimal protection.**I received a sample to test and evaluate in exchange for an honest review**</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-19:</strong> iPhone 5 is best left naked to show off its sheer, sleek beauty. I get asked to show it to most people when it's bare. Every case seems to hide away its sleekness but are necessary for protection as it is a slippery little thing. So after using 7 different cases on the iPhone 5 this case is currently my #2.The positives- Slide in convenience where the phone can be taken out easily to clean it off or plug it into an external accessory- Textured back looks nice, and offers great back protection as well as enhanced grip- Material does not pick up dust and lint from the pocket or bag- The front edge is sleek enough to let almost the full screen of the iPhone 5 show through, it is slightly higher than the screen surface to act as a bumper to protect the screen.- The cutouts are nicely placed and do not interfere with operation, charging cords, camera functions etc.- Case is lightweight and does not add too much heft, sleek looks still maintains the slim profile of the iPhone 5The concerns- Protection is medium as the case seems to slide off too easy. I haven't dropped my phone yet with the case on but it does not seem very protective compared to rubberized cases or Otterbox cases- Case can become loose over time. The advantage of slide in convenience also makes the case almost too easy to slide off and may become even looser over time.This case wins over the AmazonBasics caseAmazonBasics Clear Back Cover with Screen Protector for iPhone 5(Too blah and hard, not enough protection), several Belkin casesBelkin View Case / Cover for Apple iPhone 5 - 1 Pack - Carrying Case - Retail Packaging - Black(Too much bulk, hard surface and easily scratchable back, picks up dirt) and others that I tried.There is a lot to love about this case, especially if you knock around your phone and want to prevent scratches on the easily-scratchable iPhone 5 surface. However, I still prefer my cheap $2 bumper caseNew iPhone 5 Bumper Case Black Transparent TPU Clear - AT&T; / VERIZON / SPRINTover this case as that one offers me the lowest profile and no-case sleekness with the bumper protection I need to protect the screen. I did install a screen protector as I find that helps keep the screen from shattering if dropped. However, the bumper case is not very durable so if you're looking for something to last more than 6 months, this case is the better option.This Acase Citta case is an all-rounder and would be fabulous if it was priced a bit lower - closer to $12.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-24:</strong> I like Acase's Citta line of Iphone 5 cases. It is sleek, has a unique design, and is very slim.Essentially, the case is cut and has a full opening along the left side (where the side buttons are). You can just slip the iphone into the opening and the case closes in.The open cut along the right side is designed with very fine cuts, diagonally cut to give the iphone 5 a very "sharp" look.In the sunlight, it is flashy yet classy. It has a subtle shine off the backside of the case.However, in spite of the design and cool look, I was disappointed at the case's protection capabilities. Due to the opening of the case on the right side, my lady's iphone catapulted out of the case when the phone was dropped. At the point of contact, there is a dent on the top left corner, and unfortunately, there was also a small dent on the top left corner of the iphone.I really like the case's design and look. It stands out. However, just be wary this case may not have the best design for protecting your Iphone 5.3.5/5 stars</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-03:</strong> The design of the Citta Slide-In Protective case is very innovative. The last case I reviewed for Acase was a leather one.  It was quite elegant, but needed a bit of breaking in before it would be fully functional.  This one is very user-friendly and you are good to go in a matter of seconds.  It's a simple matter to get the iPhone 5 in the case.  Simply pull apart two sides as if you were looking into a billfold, tuck your iPhone in, and release.  The fit is snug while you have open access to all the ports and features.  There are no specific cut-outs save for the iSight camera.This case definitely passes in the protection department. The polycarbonate (PC) outer shell is tough and impact-resistant. Polycarbonate will scratch, but the application of Japanese paint has obviously remedied that situation. FYI, Japanese paints are among the best in the world. Nice choice and it gives the shell an sleek look, while adding that much-needed protection.  There is a raised front lip around the front edge that will protect the screen if you place in face down on any surface.  Mind you, this will offer up some protection in case of drops, but there are always those freak accidents.The slate gray case has a basket weave raised design that makes it easy to grip.  The edges are beveled, a feature that makes it easier to hold.  The distinctive Acase logo is centered on the lower front.  The polycarbonate shell isn't going to scratch (I tried) nor will fingerprints and dirt adhere to its surface, something that I appreciate.  This is the type of case that's functional, yet practical.  It's a decent case that will take a beating while offering up reasonably good protection for your phone.  I really like this case!This case courtesy of the manufacturer.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-06:</strong> How about that, a case that's actually EASY to use. Your iPhone 5 easily slides into the clamshell design case and is easily removed as well. The high quality case is fitted perfectly and therefore holds the phone securely. Slim case provides protection without bulk and looks good.What I truly love is that they've designed the case so you have excellent access to all ports, switches, microphone, and speakers. You can use the phone and accessories without the compromise you have with most cases (where you often have to struggle to remove the case in order to to charge your phone, use headphones, etc.).This company has taken a much needed re-look at what an iPhone case should be and how inconveniences found in other cases could be avoided. This fresh thinking is much appreciated by this iPhone user.Highly recommended!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-13:</strong> I've tried a couple of cases before stumbling upon this one. Most cases are made of some sort of flexible rubber, and require you to wrestle your phone into them. The result is that you usually loosen up the case if you take your phone in and out of it a few times.With this case, however, you slide the phone in through the side; the case is actually almost in two pieces, with the halves only joined at the right side of the phone. Surprisingly, the case makes a solid and tight connection with the phone itself, such that once it's on, it feels like a single solid unit. It's a very nice design, and it allows them to use a nice solid, high quality plastic instead of some cheap rubbery material. With the addition of a metallic paint, the case has a very solid feel, and resists scratches.While the price is a bit high, it's actually the first case where I think the cost is justified. It's a very well-designed case made of high quality materials that will last.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> I was contacted by the company that makes these cases to select a phone case and review it. I personally only have an iPhone 4S, so I agreed to review the case and gave it to my mother because she has an iPhone 5. The follow is what she had to say about the case:"The phone case was very easy to put on my phone & very easy to take off when I wanted a change.  The color is nice & the added protection of the front piece is an added bonus.  When I'm texting, the front "cover" makes it a bit difficult to type in the letters symbols on the edges of the keyboard.  I usually have to tap the letters/symbols multiple times.  I'm used to a "slick-feeling" case that makes my phone easy to slide into my back pocket - this phone slides but not quite as easily as a slick case with rounded corners. The texture made it easy to find in my purse - a good thing since it falls out of the pocket on the inside of my purse a lot  and I often end up digging around for it.  All-in-all, a nice case and good value."</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BSWN0S8" id="B00BSWN0S8-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-04:</strong> I have tried so many cases for the iPhone5, and I haven't seen anything as easy to install as this Acase.  The opening is on the side and all you have to do is slide it in.  My phone has a screen protector, and that is not a problem at all.  Once the phone has snapped in, it is secured and will not fall out unless you pry it open.All the controls are completely accessible. The only thing that is not completely protected is the screen, but with the raised bezel, it won't get scratched even if you place the phone face down.  The case has a rubberized feel and it is unlikely to slide from you hand. The back has a diamond texture with a small logo at the bottom.  This is a well thought out case for the iPhone5, very simple but cleverly designed.Sample item provided by the distributor for evaluation review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BSWN0S8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BSWN0S8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0098T62GA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0098T62GA</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This is a good case.  Once you figure out how to put the thing on, it feels very solid and has a good grip in the hand especially if you play games.  BUT... One of the many reasons I bought an S4 is because of how thin it is (reportedly thinner than that upcoming S5) and this case, although I like it, sacrificed that for me.  The phone is just to big to be dangling at your side (IMO) so I stuck it in my pocket with the case and no belt clip.  The kickstand on the inner case is a nice touch, but it's silly to also have a kickstand on the outer case that can't be used with this phone (this case is apparently made very similar for several phones, the S4 cannot be flipped for the screen facing outward in the belt clip case).  One minor problem I had was that the rubber lip of this case seemed to ever so slightly pull up my screen protector, just in one spot.  That could have been the way it was applied...Like I said, good case.... But in the end I opted for a good screen protector and a gamble with my pocket. If you don't mind a tiny bit of extra bulk (probably less bulk than any otterbox or whatever you can buy in a VZW store) and especially if you need a kickstand for your phone which is increasingly rare in quality cases, then this is for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-03:</strong> It is very durable as advertised.

I have used the kick plate and it is nice for use with movies or at night if you use a sound machine app (or an alarm clock.I would rate this higher but the leg for the kick-stand is too loose when stowed away.

Kickstand works well and the dual layer protection still results in a very slim overall package.  Would have given it 5 stars, however the belt clip is problematic.  When the phone is turned sideways on your belt, the clip protrudes beyond and above the edge of the phone and digs/cuts into your flesh (having a &#34;spare tire&#34; doesn't help, either, I admit).  The belt clip rotates180 degrees, but over the short span of a month, became a little loose from the case cover to which it is attached.  Not bad, just allows the phone to rotate a bit while on your belt.  The inside of the case cover is felt-lined, but over time a small protrusion of plastic is starting to push through the felt as the belt clip becomes more loosely attached.  It still won't touch the cell screen, but I wonder how much worse it will get.  I'm just darn picky, though, and this is the slimmest yet most protective case I've found....but they really need to redesign that belt clip.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-04:</strong> This is a 2-part case.  A soft silicone that goes directly on the phone (like a glove) and then the hard plastic that fits over it and latches onto the phone.  Together it provides a good grip and good protection.  The silicone is a bit slidy though so when you put the hard plastic over, it sometimes doesn't have a perfect fit.  Everything still works fine, nothing gets in the way or falls  it just looks less than perfect..If you need to change batteries, it is, probably obviously, a bit more work to take this off and on than is a 1-piece case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-27:</strong> The rubber portion of the case did not fit well on my S4.

I think this i-Blason is the one for my S4.I needed a case that protects well, looks good, but is not bulky, as well as a holster.  This one seems to cover all the bases.  The dual-layer case combines the cushioning of the rubber interior cover with the protection of the hard exterior hard shell.  But the overall profile is still relatively slim.  The exposed silicon gives a good grip for handling the phone.The case has a nicely raised lip that would protect the screen in a face-down drop.The holster swivels on a ratchet so that you can adjust its angle easily, but it doesn't flop around freely.  The phone fits securely enough in the holster such that I don't fear losing it, but I have no difficulty removing it.  My only concern is how the silicon will wear after months of sliding in and out of the holster.  So far, so good.The stand feature is a nice bonus, although I doubt I'll use it.Recommended!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review22" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-12:</strong> It's a 3 piece protection unit; 2 without the clip. The first is a silicone/rubber sleeve (I guess you can call it) that goes over the phone, and the 2nd piece is a hard plastic backing that emphasizes protection on the four corners and in the middle of the sides. The silicone sleeve has a raised edge that protects your screen in case you drop the phone face down. There are holes for your headphones, usb, camera+flash, speaker, and mic at the bottom that have adequate room so it's not like you have to have it fit exactly in, and also the power and volume buttons have pre-fitted coverings over them that function just fine. The stand at the back is sturdy although it doesn't feel like it, but stands my phone on my desk without falling or anything; keep in mind it is a tab difficult to get it out but that works out perfect so it's not just flapping everywhere when it's folded and not in use The belt clip has a locking swivel so you can secure it at different positions on your belt, and is also made of a hard plastic just like the backing.On a side note, I chose to Ghost Armor my phone from personal experience, but mainly for screen protection. Phone cases do trap in dirt and can scratch your phone, so I opted to get additional protection under the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review23" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-10:</strong> Great case.

I don't have much use for holsters and has not fiddled with it initially, opting to just go with the case.  Then I decided that the holster, with its clip, might perform well in my vehicle for holding the phone when used as a GPS.  The only problem is that to do this, the phone must be removed from the case to be put in the holster.  It is an EITHER/OR relationship.  That was a disappointment.  Because I refuse to carry my phone without the case, I can't use the holster and so have no comments on the function of the holster.The case fits and functions well.  I have trouble getting the phone into it with all the rubber in place and not stretched out of position.  Unless you are into putting in and taking out your phone a lot, this should not be an issue.  I have had to do it twice when I needed access inside the phone.  Otherwise, everything you need to access the phone (buttons, surfaces, ports, etc.) are easy to access.As corners are areas in need of the most protection from damage from dropping, I was bothered that they were not better covered by the "polycarbonate" skeletal shell.I like and use the kickstand on the case.All in all, the case functions well.  I am sorry I paid money for the holster that can't be used with the case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-04:</strong> love it, but this is the second one because it seemed to strecthout of shape.

I also love that this case has a front cover for when I put my phone freely in my purse, I don't have to worry about the screen getting smashed or stabbed or poked (because my magic bag of holding (my purse) has things in there that will do all that ;)). I don't use the clip on the front cover as intended, instead I use it to hold my rolled up earbuds, works great! The only problem, and it's not a big one, is that it's a little hard to get it on the phone with the rubber and the plastic aligned, because they are two separate pieces, but if you just work with it a little and shift it here and there you'll get.

This one at 15 bucks was the most expensive. Also the best one of the 3 I bought. Fits like a glove, amazing soft and hard protection, kickstand rocks and holster makes for complete protection as it goes in face first (for the S4). If you have an I-phone I guess it faces out and you can use the kickstand on the holster while standing vertical. Not sure who would watch their phone in vertical position but I guess. For me, the face in for the S4 provides 100% protection when out hiking, biking, etc. and is not inconvenient in any way. This one gets 5 stars because it was everything I wanted and it was only 15 bucks. A tad bulkier than the slim models, but my first phone back in the early 90's was as big as a small radio so who are we kidding here. Still fits in any pocket without the holster with no problems.

By saying &#34;ease&#34; I'm kidding, it's is almost impossible to get the phone from your belt clip with one hand.  You can push it forward with your thumb and sometimes it moves or slides out but most of the time it just pushes the clip around your belt until you get to the next belt loop on your pants.  Then it is a battle between how well your loop a sewn to the pants or the superglued case to the clip.  Sometimes I just don't use the clip and put the phone in my pocket.  The clip is just too tightly fitting around the phonecase.  I've tried bending the hooks on the clip to open up a little but that hurts and plastic these days have excellent memory and go right back.In summary... supersoinc protection for the phone with a clip that would probably survive a bomb blast.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review43" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-08:</strong> Really nice case and made very well.

Initial fit-on takes some time and dexterity due to close fit, but separating stiff ''X-brace'' from soft surround skin, slipping on skin, then carefully fitting brace on right first, then left side with thumbnail between brace and skin to provide a slide-on fit seems to work well.  All buttons and openings fit quite precisely (uncommon on some similar cases), and case is just thin enough to let you use cell in the Samsung Desk Dock/Charger unit (an excellent accessory, if you add right-angle USB cord).  Pop-out Horizontal stand works easy and is very stable.  Black face-protector Clip-on/Stand works great as a Clip-on, but curved phone/case back prevents mounting face-protector backwards to use its vertical stand feature as shown (no great loss).  Having a Face-Protection for an expensive, delicate, glass touch-screen is good ''insurance'' and prevent ''butt-dialing'' errors, too.  At the price that we paid, this product is a good bargain considering it is much better quality materials and fit than most alternatives... vs 4 very poor fitting, poor working alternatives we tried.

The kickstand conveniently snaps in and out of place, and is a nice feature for those who may use it. I wanted an orange case but they don't offer that color. The case looks tough and it makes the S4 easier to handle. It's still a tad slick but nothing like it is without a case. The other colors are too bright for me, so I ended up ordering black which is not my favorite because I want a case with some level of color.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review57" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-07:</strong> I was excited to get this case for my new Samsung Galaxy S4. The reviews on it were decent, and the pictures made it look pretty good as well. Boy was I wrong!!The rubber paft of the case, that goes onto the phone first, seems to fit pretty well. Once you try to put the plastic outer shell on it though, it shoves the rubber off of the corners and sides of the phone, and is VERY difficult to get the two pieces lined up correctly. After 3-5 minutes of messing with it, I came to the conclusion that iot just will NEVER fit the phone correctly.To add to this, the case can only go into the holster face down, meaning once the phone is holstered, you have no access to the screen.This will not work for me, as I use my phone for music while riding my bike/jogging, and I need to be able to pop the phone offo f my waist (holster and all) and make adjustments to the songs playing, or apps that I am using.My previous phone was in an Otterbox Defender case, and I was able to holster the phone face up (or face out, as you might say) and this worked great. Not to mention, the case itself fit the phone 100x better than this one!I just placed my order for the Otterbox. I hate to pay the extra money, but after &#34;experimenting&#34; with one of these cheaper cases, I have learned my lesson. Never again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-13:</strong> Saved my phone many times and i love the kickstand to viewing media.

I will update it as necessary!Finally, after trying out 3 cases (Tridea S View Case and Maxboost Shell), I think I have a winner. S View didn't work out as well as I had hoped it would, and the Maxboost case did not offer enough protection...but convinced me that I want a kickstand, darnit!LOOKS/FEEL: I really didn't want my phone to end up looking like a large version of my girlfriend's Otterbox'd behemoth...and since the S4 is a fairly large phone to begin with, I didn't want it to add too much size...and I must say I am quite happy. This case adds a nice soft rubber feel to the phone...albeit a bit lacking in "gripiness"...without adding much bulk. It feels good in my hand and I don't notice much of a size difference from "naked". The back is a bit sporty and rugged while on the front you merely see a protective rubber border that's not very intrusive at all. The cutouts are well done and professional.BUTTONS: ...THANK YOU! I am so glad to have switched to a case with this kind of extended button design. Naked, the S4's buttons lack texture and clickiness that helps me press them easily and know for sure that I pressed them properly. My last two cases had cutouts, making the buttons recessed, that made them slightly more difficult to press. This case puts little rubber buttons on top of the actual buttons and they stick out from the case slightly...pressing them is almost perfect! Sometimes this kind of design can be done poorly and result in problems but my initial thoughts are "YESSSSSSS!" I will update this if I change my mind at all.PROTECTION: This is where my last case failed. While it looked good and had a nice kickstand that was sweet enough to offer portrait and horizontal reclining, it left the top/bottom of the phone's front exposed to danger. This phone is too expensive to possibly drop it and have to HOPE that it lands on a protected spot. I'm quite confident that this i-Blason case will save my phone from any reasonable damage if dropped. The plastic and rubber protect the entire back and the rim around the entire front sticks up a few millimeters, offering just enough of a guard without looking like a miniature car tire.KICKSTAND: I decided that a kickstand is a must for me. It's such a simple little design that adds an important functionality...I don't understand why so few popular cases have one. While the Maxboost case I tried offered both portrait and horizontal viewing, it also seemed a bit flimsier and more prone to breaking than the i-Blason version. At first I pulled out the kickstand and thought: "uh oh, it's not clicking into place". I had read some reviews that this was a problem...but I quickly realized that it takes TWO STEPS to fully open it. First you pull the kickstand out with your pointer finger's nail...then you grab the smaller lever below it with your thumb & pointer finger, pulling it out until it snaps into place. I actually just trimmed my nails to do this review and while it's not quite as easy with a 100% trimmed fingernail, it was still fairly effortless. It's also worth noting that the kickstand holds the phone up more securely than the Maxboost case: the face of the phone can take a decent amount of force without falling over backwards.HOLSTER: I am definitely amused by the fact that they design the holster with a kickstand but the S4 can only go screen down into it...oh well...I will likely never use the holster anyways. I did try it out and felt that it worked properly...held the device securely...and functioned as I would expect. I watched the Youtube video (see my comment/reply to this review) and it showed me that the proper way to use the holster was with the clip facing down so that the "bottom" part of the holster would hold the phone in (against gravity, etc.) and the phone face down/top down in it. You can then easily remove it using two fingers hooked over the top of the phone.INSTALLATION: A lot of people have been complaining about the installation process and the poor fit. I'm not sure if that was user error and/or early design defects that have been fixed, but for me it was a breeze. I did watch the 2 minute video first (again, see my reply/comment for the link), but after that it took less than a minute to have the case on, snug, and done. Not even the slightest problem or annoyance here.OTHER: So far my only minor complaint, which I read in another person's review, is that the holster and accompanying raised rubber design effects are placed only in the center of the phone. As a result, it's not entirely stable when laid down on a flat surface. If you press the screen, especially on the top or the bottom, it will wobble a decent amount. They could have easily added a few small design effects on the corner, raised evenly with the center, to create a completely stable/level surface. I'd take half a star off for this if I could.OVERALL: For $13.99, I am extremely satisfied. This is, in my opinion, an Otterbox/Seidio quality case with a kickstand, for a fraction of the price. Time will tell whether or not it holds up as well, but so far I'm very happy!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-24:</strong> I was leery that this case wouldn't be the perfect fit for my new iPhone 5s. I know the 5 and 5s's dimensions are the same, however, I was afraid that there would be an issue around the flash area on the back. The 5s has dual flash (2 small flash bulbs, 1 on top of the other). The way the camera/flash cut out on the back of this case looked, I didn't know if any part of the flash would be covered up a little, since it's taller than the single 5 flash. Well it didn't! No issues with this case on the 5s and fits like a glove. Once you get the outer hard shell enclosure over the inner silicone layer adjusted, the whole thing looks like it's 1 piece and could take a heck of a beating. Nicely done and seamless construction. Best bang for the buck! I was a sole Otterbox user. "Was". Great alternative for you Otter users.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-14:</strong> I like the Blason Armorbox and the Otterbox better but the plastic on the outside of the Blasons is too slippery.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review63" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-12:</strong> I just received this case and it looks as good as is the one I ordered time ago for my Samsung S4</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review64" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-02:</strong> The i-Blason Motorola Moto X Prime Series Dual Layer Holster Case worked ideally for my moto-X ...I have absolutely no complaints other than the finish wears off.......improve that part and yu would get six stars if possible...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-26:</strong> Love the protection it provides to my s4 and the stand to watch videos without having to hold the mobile..go iBlason</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review66" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> works may be... good for small hits... not sure about how it will protect if I drop.. never dared to test it...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review67" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> Silicone insert with hard shell.

The purple is a perfect shade and goes well with the black. The case is easy to place on the phone and the holes line up perfectly with the ports on my Samsung Galaxy S4 phone. But, it's not a snug fit. Given the material, it may eventually conform to the phone. I don't plan on using the holster, but it appears sturdy. I'm not sure that it's a very protective case, though. I purchased this case for the kickstand. However, I can't open the kickstand without using an object such as a toothpick or knife, etc. I thought it might snap out, but that's not the case either. Given this design flaw, I wouldn't consider this a user-friendly case...at least not at this point.3/27/14  FOLLOW-UP REVIEW: I now have 2 of these cases and really like them. They do fit my Galaxy S4 very well now and they do protect my phone. The kickstands on both eventually loosened up enough so that I can now use them without any trouble.

But protection is worth it.The second negative is the gel case; it is rather floppy so you need the black case around it in addition to the holster.

The kick stand on the case is very functional if you watch a lot of movies. Not sure why the holder has a kick stand since the screen will face inwards. The only difficulty is getting the phone in and out of the holder. It's a very tight fit.

I had already tried the Amazon Basics case for the phone and was really pleased with it, I just did not have a way to put it on my belt.  After seeing this product, I decided to give it a try.  Here is what I liked:1.  The case goes on easily (two parts, soft silicon and a hard plastic shell).2.  The case provides a very good grip.  Much better than the smooth sides of the Amazon Basic case.3.  The holster clip has a safety tab that keeps it from being pulled from your belt when you bump up against something or when you sit down.4.  The phone fits easily into the holster.  While it takes a bit of pressure to put it in and take it out, it ensures that the phone does not fall out!!5.  The holster has a feature that allows you to use it off the belt to hold your I-Phone in the vertical position.6.  The case has an easy to pull out tab that holds the phone securely in a horizontal position.What I did not like:While most audio cords fit without issue, I have found a couple that are a bit wider than the opening in the case and this prevents them from plugging in.  However, 95% of the devices and extension cables I have fit.  The only ones that did not were off brand.For the price, I think this is an outstanding value and I would highly recommend it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review117" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-29:</strong> 4.5 Stars for me.I got this case because I wanted a holster option but with a case that covered all of the edges of the phone.  When you first go to put your phone in the case your are going to think "what the heck it does not fit!"  Relax and follow these steps because you need to realize that this is a soft/hard combo and you need to install one after the other in order to get a proper fit.1. Peel the rubber part away from the hard case.2. Place your phone into the rubber part.3. Now place the entire thing into the hard case.4. Massage around the endges of the phone until all of the rubber has settled into the right place.  You will be able to tell because it will "look right".5. EnjoyOther thoughts.- I like the look of the case, very manly.- The phone slides in and out of the holster at the perfect amount of resistance as to not worry about it falling out but not so difficult to be a pain in the butt.- The kickstand is a cool feature and works well.I was not sure about this case when I ordered it but I am now glad I did becuase I did not want to buy an Otterbox which has that stupid screen protector on it.  This case/holster combo is a very good option alternate to otterbox.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review118" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-25:</strong> I like the color combination.  In person it looks a touch darker than the picture - which is actually an improvement.  With the screen turned toward the holster the phone is fully covered (great if you have to carry that beautiful iPhone 5 when you're doing heavy work). the protector come is 2 parts, the blue, single piece, silicon rubber protector that covers the edges (full cover except for necessary cutouts) and a black semi-hard plastic &#34;frame&#34; that grabs the corners and long sides and covers the back of the phone.  That frame has a landscape kickstand.  the above assembly fits into the plastic holster with a 2 inch wide belt clip.  It can be installed either screen in (full covert mode) or screen out.  In the screen out configuration the belt clip doubles as a two-way kickstand (landscape or portrait).  really quite handy!As others have mentioned, the 2 piece assembly is a little difficult to slide out of the holster. It comes out but with significant resistance.  I pull it out slowly because I don't want to deform and cut or stretch the silicon protector.  It's a little negative for me, which is the reason for the 4 star rating, but one thing for sure - someone trying to &#34;pick my holster&#34; will not do so unnoticed.  Since I've known people who've had cell phones stolen from holsters i'm kind of glad this won't be easy pickin's for them.  Just wish it were a little easier for me!I've already recommended it to others.  One guy said &#34;so, this will withstand a direct nuclear hit, right?&#34; I took it as a compliment.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review119" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-25:</strong> I recently purchased the Samsung Galaxy S4, and probably like everyone else, (or most), I purchased the Otterbox Defender case to go wit it... While I think the Otterbox case is great for protecting your phone from accidental drops, I am O.C.D. when it comes to dust! I don't know if it was just me, or if the Otterbox was a &#34;dust&#34;magnet... I was constantly trying to clean my screen, only to realize that it was underneath the screen protector. I tried blowing, using canned air, and then finally just taking it apart to clean the dust out....then two days later, it was back again! My previous phone was a Droid Incredible, and I purchased a shell holster carrier similar to the &#34;i-Blason&#34;. It wasn't covered in rubber, with screen protectors and such, but I didn't have to take it apart to clean my screen. When I saw the&#34;i-Blason&#34;, (and especially for the price), I said hell yes! It's true that I have to be a little more careful of drops and such, but the case does offer protection from the rubberized bumber that surrounds the phone, however, even with the bumper guard, the case is extremely thin, (as opposed to the Otterbox), and the felt lined case holds it extremely tight and secure. The phone faces inward in the holster, so the screen is always protected, and if you want to watch a movie, or a YouTube video, then simply fold out the kickstand, and sit it down.

The inner rubber liner absorbs minor shocks and the harder outer shell spreads out the impact.  The 3 part design is pretty perfect,  There is a built in stand on the hard shell part of the phone holder and there is a separate stand on the belt case.  It would have been nice if you could use the belt case with the phone side exposed but you really don't need that since the phone holder has its own stand.  Great design and looks very cool.

The phone cradle consists of a soft rubber sleeve that holds the phone, which as an assembly clips into a hard plastic carrier. This assembly is then retained by the holster.Once assembled the phone assembly is held by friction, and lots of it in the holster. It can be removed on handed by pushing on the bottom, and has enough features and texture to be easily and securely held.My biggest gripe is that getting the phone and rubber liner installed in the cradle is a major pain. It is not clear if the rubber gets assembled into the plastic before the phone is added or if it is first put on the phone and then the assembly put in the plastic. I tried both ways and neither was particularly easy, in part due to the stretchy nature of the rubber that has to fit under the rather inflexible plastic tabs.Once it is installed to your satisfaction it is a nice enough system and is currently being used. I have 3 other cases that will be tried before I decide on which to stock up on. My previous experience with similar cases is that they break pretty easily when caught on things exiting the car, particularly when a passenger. I thus keep a few spares on hand of any design I like and don't worry about it.Right now this device is a thumbs up.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review125" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> It is a pretty nice case but I found a almost identical case , another brand for about a half the price with free shipping so I wished I would have found it first.

I didn't care if it had a holster, but I did want protection first and foremost, and I wanted a kickstand.This case was perfect. It fits snuggly, and I haven't had an issue putting it on or taking it off as others have noted. Another review had a video on how he installed it, and it has helped me. I think the back of the case is stylish (I got the black case), and even with the kickstand, the case is still quite slim. The case comes in two parts: a rubberized case for protection from drops, and then a hard plastic case that snaps on after you've put the rubberized case.The only issue I've had is that sometimes when I need to touch something on the edge of the screen, it can be a little difficult. This is because the case sticks up a few millimeters all around the edge to protect it if I should drop it. I don't use the holster so I can't review that although when I first got it, I did slide it in and out of the holster a few times, and it seemed to fit securely, and was easy to slide in/out.If you fouind this review helpful, please click YES so that others may find it more easily.

The S4 was no different. And in accordance with the 4.5/5 stars this is rated at by the mass majority, this is a great case for the phone.Pros:Well protected with a gel interior case and a hard shell exterior caseThe kickstand (which admittedly feels a bit flimsy but has so far held up) is a fancy featureThe belt clip holster is holds the phone very securely when inserted into itCons:Like I said, the kickstand is a bit flimsy, but as long as it holds up, I have no complaintsCould've come with a screen protectorSo far, the phone has already been dropped onto concrete once from about 4 feet up =/. However, the case doesn't even have a scratch.But for the price and overall quality, the cons do not justify take off any stars from my rating. 5 stars for this case all the way.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review136" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-25:</strong> Not for me, too bulky and awkward to get the phone out when you want to answer a call.Its tight too i had to almost force the phone out of the holster.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review137" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-20:</strong> This case fits the Samsung galaxy s4 perfectly.

I've gone through about four different cases for my iPod 3rd gen, so I thought that most cases out there are just poorly made or felt loose.This case is very high quality.  The fit is a near perfect fit.  The rubberized case (the inner most part of three parts) is re-inforced by a &#34;backbone&#34; piece (the center part of the three parts) which will prevent the rubberized case from stretching or expanding over time.  The iphone 5 feels very secure in the belt clip, but not too tight and secure that you can't easily pull it out.Overall, the quality and the execution of the product is spot-on.  I highly recommend it to anyone out there with an iPhone 5 looking for a rugged case...</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review141" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-06:</strong> I like this case a lot .. it works great at protecting my iPhone C and matches the green of the phone perfectly so where it shows through is seamless.

It looks good and the kick stand is easy to open.  I don't use the holster so I can't comment on that.My only criticism is of the silicone shell. The consistency of the silicone is too soft. When I drag the edge of the silicone cover away from the phone with my finger, it pulls away too easily. When I put the phone in my pocket, I can feel the silicone part of the cover dragging a bit. I think it is just a little to rubbery. This is not a deal breaker.

Case has 2 parts, 1st is the rubber glove that fits snug and button access is precise. 2nd part is the hard plastic backing that fits around the rubber to make it rigid, added feature is that the backing has a &#34;kick stand&#34; to prop up your phone to watch videos, etc. The holster also has a &#34;kick stand&#34;, and the only con I have is both have only one position to prop up your phone. I can live with this one! The holster is made of a thicker plastic and the spring belt clip looks like solid construction. The clip also has multiple positions so that you can rotate your phone to accommodate any sitting position. The inside of the holster has a thin layer of felt, I'm guessing to protect the phones screen. This really is not necessary due to the rubber glove being raised to keep the screen of the phone from being scratched.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review154" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-27:</strong> I have dropped my new S4 probably 3-5 times getting in and out of my car.This case is rugged and it stays on my belt without constantly slipping off.Most importantly, it has protected my $200 purchase without one single scratch.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0098T62GA" id="B0098T62GA-review155" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-14:</strong> When I tried to seat my Galaxy S-4 into the case, I could not get it to lock in.

That being said, the case is a bit thick on my 4S, feeling like there is a bit of slack - but it does offer a great amount of protection and the iphone is securely seated.

I have the all Black case, and it's great. I had one minor issue when installing the case, there are long oval shaped holes that run along the long sides of the silicon portion of the case, and at first when I tried to put the plastic case over top, I had some (what looked like) excess silicon folding over the phone on the one side, and I thought the silicon seemed too big for the plastic case, but you have to line up the holes in the silicon with the similarly shaped plastic raised portions on the inside of the plastic part. Once they're lined up it fits great, and looks great as well. I thought this case might have a pretty big lip/overhang around the edges of the screen that might hinder your fingers, and touchscreen, but it's not that noticeable at all. The plastic doesn't seem very "heavy duty" or really that hard at all, just normal everyday plastic, but if you're not throwing, slamming, or forcefully dropping your phone for any reason, I don't see any issues with the plastic breaking necessarily. It probably will scratch on really rough surfaces, and it probably won't stand up to any crazy abuse, but it'll protect your phone from the everyday wear and tear. If you're looking for a case that you can completely disregard any type of NORMAL phone use, and truely abuse, then go with a defender, or similarly tough case. But if you're looking for good, everyday protection, and you're not someone who puts their phone through alot of abuse, this is a perfect case for you. I know alot of people who trust the Otterbox name, so I went with this case, this brand.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0064UA1QI" id="B0064UA1QI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-31:</strong> This is a great case and I like that I can mix and match the different parts of the case with any other commuter series cases as well!

I decided on getting the Grey/Yellow combo because I thought it looked pretty cool and it stood out...but the rubberized yellow part of the case discolors after carrying it around for only ONE day! I had this in and out of my coat pocket and just from slipping it in and out the yellow has turned "muddy-looking" and just looks BAD. I can't believe I have only owned this for a total of three days and the yellow part is so insanely discolored.That isn't the only problem I have with the case though. I am also not a fan of the docking port flap/opening. The rubber tab has given me a ton of trouble opening and closing it. It now won't even close the entire way. It just kind of 'hangs there' in a droopy state.I also dislike how little traction this case provides in terms of gripping. It's a slippery case. I need a case with more of a sturdy grip that won't slide right out of my hands. I'm far too clumsy to be walking around with something like this in my hand. I KNOW it's going to fly out and smash to the ground soon.I am normally a fan of Otterbox and I actually just wound up purchasing the Defender for mine to replace this so I don't dislike the brand at all. I just have had a lot of problems with my specific case.On the plus side...I like the solidity of this case and I do think it is a step up from the Reflex series for protection. I don't really trust the two-part/snap together cases. They make me too nervous. I don't have any doubts about this case weathering a lot of knicks and dings but I have had some issues.Just wanted to warn people out there about the light-color rubber getting stained easily by hands/jean pockets/coat pockets and usage. The dark rubber should be fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0064UA1QI" id="B0064UA1QI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> This case gives great protection and is relatively less bulky than their Defender.

I wanted a dark blue but this looks a bit purple. The good news is that it fits like a glove and is very durable. The bad news is that aftermarket chargers (Belkin) don't fit since the bottom opening isn't big enough. The OEM apple cables are fine though. This is the 3rd bumper case that I have gotten for my phone and I think this is as good as the OEM Apple version, for a whole lot less money.

For about two months. I never had to worry about battery power, as I would have one on charge and one in my pocket at all times- on top of the one in my phone. After a lot of recharging, the life of the Anker batteries was noticeably shorter. It wasn't too bad at first and I continued to use them for another month or so. By the end of that month (3rd), the Anker batteries held charge about 1/2 as long as the factory battery. A few weeks later, one of the batteries lasted about an hour - on standby. Then the other. Now, completely useless. So if you need this for a couple months, go for it. If you want something that will last- skip this one.EDIT: ONE DAY AFTER REVIEW:I was contacted almost immediately by the seller of this product after my review went live. They wanted to know what they could do to remedy this situation- a total surprise. They are concerned that the batteries failed and are trying to track the problem through serial numbers. They informed me that only a small percentage of the batteries behave this way and would like to make it right. I do not even own the phone these batteries go to anymore and they have offered me batteries to my current phone, which they also carry. Perhaps this is just a defect and not a seller issue. I have promised the seller I will keep updating this review as there are further developments.EDIT: TWO DAYS AFTER REVIEW:The following are copies of emails between myself and Laptop Mate, the seller. They are going above and beyond to resolve the situation. I let them know I was willing to accept replacement batteries. I have taken out last names, links and phone numbers; otherwise the emails are as copied and quoted.Email 1:"Dear Peter - Amazon Marketplace,Thank you for getting back to us with details.Really appreciate your second chance and willingness to try the batteries for Samsung Galaxy III. I just arranged two new batteries plus one charger to you, but they will be in separate packages, hope you get them soon.And as for the serial number on the batteries, if you can not find it, that is ok. Thank you for your effort on this matter.Please keep us updated how the new batteries and charger work and let us know if there is anything else we may help.SunnieLaptopmate Customer Support1-800-XXX-XXXXMon-Fri 9am to 5pm(pst)"Email 2:"Dear Peter,Based on our previous correspondence, we thought you'd like to know that your item(s) have been reshipped. You can track the package via the below link:[...]Your satisfaction is our priority, so please don't hesitate to let us know how we can assist you further. Thanks for choosing LaptopMate, and we look forward to hearing how the new product works for you.Best Regards,SunnieCustomer Satisfaction TeamLaptopMate"EDIT THREE: FOUR DAYS AFTER ORIGINAL REVIEW:I have received two brand new batteries and a brand new charger - for my current phone. LaptopMate was willing to replace the batteries and explained a small percentage of any mass produced product can be defective and they wanted to collect as much info as possible about the battery (serial number, etc) and really seemed proactive about trying to eliminate this problem. I wish I had more info for them but the serial number had worn off of the sticker on the battery that I did find.When I told LaptopMate I no longer owned the Infuse phone the original batteries were for, they offered me batteries for my current phone, the Samsung Galaxy III. They also inquired what kind of phone my wife owns and offered a battery for her as well!I am increasing the "stars" value on this review not because of the product, which I was told was an anomaly, but because of the attention to detail and willingness to please by the seller, LaptopMate. I had new batteries, probably more expensive than the last- in my hand, days after I wrote the first review.LaptopMate is TOPS.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0058SHMLE" id="B0058SHMLE-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-19:</strong> This charger is the best charger made,it will charge any cell phone and digital camera battery,the batteries are very good also........</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0058SHMLE', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0058SHMLE', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009MPHRCI</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009MPHRCI</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

The backlight turns on, but the LCD does not display a picture.  I have experience repairing Iphones, and am familiar with how to do it.  I took the old screen and plugged the connectors in, and the old screen worked perfectly fine.The new screen came well packed in a nice plastic container with foam on both sides.  The tools that came with it were okay, but I usually use my own set of magnetic screwdrivers.  The screen removal tools are usually 1 time use, as they usually get eaten up.  This screen also came with double sided tape in the shape of the phone.  It was not cut specifically for this phone, so I used bits and pieces that I cut off with scissors in some areas being sure not to obstruct the front camera or sensors.If this screen had actually worked, this would have received a 5 star rating.  It had what appeared to be an inspection sticker on it, which gave me confidence that the screen would work properly, but it could have just been a part number or even inspection rejection sticker.  I really wanted this screen to work.  The fit of the screw lugs was perfect.  On another screen replacement job, the replacement screen worked, but the screw lugs were badly toleranced and I had to drill them out to get the screws to fit.  This one lined up very well and got my hopes up, but the screen itself did not work.Now I have to wait for another replacement screen, and I have to do the full disassembly and reassembly process over again.  I hope other people have better luck.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A712FE6" id="B00A712FE6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-25:</strong> Ive order multiple items from Bravolink and they don't disappoint ever.

Experience and the right tools will make any job a success.  4 star rating only because the tools supplied are not the greatest, but will do the job if you have the patience.  Screen loves fingerprints, but I always use a screen protector anyway so it doesn't bother me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A712FE6" id="B00A712FE6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-04:</strong> Item:Item and tools came in a small box with plenty of padding.  Item is good enough.  Ever so slightly thicker than the original glass but I swear I wouldn't have even noticed if it had been for other reviewers.  Tint seemed fine but I wouldn't know because I ended up pulling the digitizer cable too far and ripped it.  In my opinion the digitizer seemed too short but I'll never know for sure.About me:I do IT consulting and I consider myself fairly technical.  I play with hardware all the time and I've had my share of laptop repairs from screen replacement to even motherboard replacements but this screen thing is at a whole new level.  Once my initial attempt failed I tried putting the old broken screen back in, but it was too late.  I ended up getting a replacement phone altogether.Conclusion:Bottom line is that whether you feel qualified to do this repair yourself or not it's too high risk.  If you mess up your laptop you have other means to connect.  If your phone is gone, it's like cutting off your lifeline.  Perhaps part of me wanted this phone gone so I could get a new 4G phone, but the end point is that I suffered dearly for it because I didn't have a backup plan and had a trip coming.Recommendations:If you absolutely must take on this endeavor be sure to backup your phone with means to access your contacts and calendar online in the very least.  I recommend using a Gmail account to keep it all synched.  Also if you end up replacing your phone and the only thing you have is a dumb phone beware that the carrier may force you to switch plans along with it.  Lastly, if you end up purchasing a phone online be sure you get it from a reputable vendor for it might be stolen and Verizon black lists stolen phones and won't let you switch into them.  When speaking with a rep he told me I should first ask for the ESN and check with them before purchase.  Worst case scenario you can always get a prepaid and have your calls forwarded as an emergency measure.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A712FE6" id="B00A712FE6-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-22:</strong> The first one was defective, which I found out after spending 4 hours putting it on, checking forums for where I could possibly have gone wrong (I couldn't have as it turns out), removing it to clean, and putting it on again. Excellent. The second one from the same listing came from a different seller and had a pink adhesive instead of the blue, so I guess it was slightly different. It went on well and works. I do often get a slight delay that I never got with my factory glass, but I can deal with that for $30 (a $120 savings over Apple replacing the phone- they do not replace front glass). I'd have given it 3 stars except the first one coming defective (a common problem from the reviews) and wasting a whole night and another week of incapacitated phone. If they had better quality control and it was a rare occurrence, I could forgive but since its common I'm taking a star off.In my first kit, the screwdriver was too large so I had to go out and buy one. For both kits I also had to buy a magnetizer (just a few bucks at home depot)- a little rectangle you put the screwdriver in to magnatize it- in order to be able to keep the screws in place long enough to screw them in. This kit is really far from perfection but if I crack my screen, I'd buy it again.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A712FE6" id="B00A712FE6-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-03:</strong> Received in less than a week and was very well packed.

It comes to pass that the clear plastic front is perhaps a millimeter or two short, making the fit slightly awkward but absolutely workable.It fits my arm well, I have 13" biceps and they look like they'll go to at least 16". It likes to slide down my sleeve so i jerk the strap in until it reminds me of a blood pressure test. Seems it's designed for direct skin contact.Something I didn't think of, buying an armband for my phone, you need a plan for when your arm rings. May want to pick up a headset if you don't have one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0044KL1XM" id="B0044KL1XM-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-04:</strong> I just wanted a cheap armband to replace the one I lost and this has exceeded my expectations. My Iphone still fits into it with its case (it's a really thin case:Acase) but it is pretty snug - just how I need it. And it hasn't stretched out one bit. I have run many miles with this and it stays in place so well that I forget it is there. I can access my apps through the front clear plastic screen no problem, just have to be a little firmer with the finger. Some reviews were saying it isn't waterproof.Would I run in the rain with it? Hello! Don't run in the rain with your iphone using any external holder unless you want it to get wet. I am not worried about sweat getting into it - and I sweat alot when I run. The back lining is absorbant so no worries.

Although it is not invisible, I was not worried about that.  I wanted something that protected my phone from scratches and smudges, etc.  This certainly does protect my phone from scratches.  And that is all it does.I didn't care it was a different touch experience.  However, it did bother me a lot after the first week when this "protector" got dirty.  I am very, very careful and my previous cell phones were never scratched or dirty.  I take excellent care of them and when I am done with them, I can sell them for a good price.I could not clean this thing out of the phone.  After that, it started making little bubbles.  I decided to take it back to the mall for exchange or to get cleaned and "unbubbled".  The lady took the bubbles out and did try to clean it but she was not able to do so.To make a long story short, I have a worthless piece of plastic that is way too expensive.  The woman at the mall's kiosk told me the cover could be replaced for $5.00. NO WAY!!!! I had already paid over $20.00 with the installation.  OK, I don't know what I am going to do with this.  I will throw it away because it is my only choice.  Next time I will look for reviews instead of making such a purchase.I have learned my lesson.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> The dry application kit is not as good as Zagg's original InvisibleSHIELD product, which has a spray-on adhesive that you use to apply the screen protector.  With the dry kit, it's more difficult than even a standard screen protector to apply (and we all know that those can be a royal pain in the rear!).  And since their warranty doesn't cover errors in application, you have to get it perfect or you're out a lot of cash for a ruined protector.Once you get it on, the display quality on the iPhone 4S is degraded quite a bit due to the texture of the screen protector.  It has a reptilian feel to it, rather than being smooth.  This texture is visible when you're looking at the display, and it negates the Retina display quality.  However, the texture *does* make the back of the phone easier to hold onto.If you want something that'll make the back of your phone easier to hold onto and grip, that will get rid of the slippery feeling of the bare iPhone, and will protect the back of your phone from scratches without changing the look of your phone much, then grab this and just apply the back portion.  The front will likely bug the heck out of you, though. :)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-16:</strong> First let me start by saying that I have used Zagg invisishield on my previous iphone 3g and 3gs. Both were very superior to this crap they're pushing out now. Seems everyone rushed to get the product out for the iphone 4 release, and put they're reputations at risk.This product whlie it does fit exactly to the phone, it just won't stay put. I,ve applied the invisishield to all my kids iphone 3g's and mine and was very pleased with them. They took a beating before they showed any signs of wear. Not with this iphone 4 shield. I applied the full body protection to both my iphone 4 and my son's. They went on easy, no bubbles, the problem is the adhesive is obviously not string enough or never dries. Whatever the reason, they silde off with the slightest movement. Forget about putting the phone in your pocket or a case, because the shield will peel right off.Now for the sad part. It seems Zagg is following in Apples foot steps claiming there is no problem with the shield, and blame it on applying error. That is just BS. Sure they'll replace it for free, but you have to pay for the shipping, packaging, gas and time to take it to the shipper, etc. In other words, they know they're getting very few back. The cost to produce these has to be next to nothing when you poduce in the volume they do. They can easily send you a replacement free without any of the above hassles.While they did respond to my e-mail, because like another reviewer said, you won't get them on the phone, they agreed to a ONE TIME REPLACEMENT!, providing I followed the above procedure. That's mighty nice of them isn't it.I got news for them, with they're CS and lifetime guarantee policy I'll stick to the silicone case for $5.00. It won't peel, won't scratch and will last a lifetime.Save your money and stay away at from this Zagg product.

The invisibleshield material sticks so well to plastic, it's almost impossible to get it off (apart from the poorly-cut corner pieces, which do get dirt under them and lift up over time).The problem with the invisibleshield/iPhone 4 combination is that the iPhone 4 isn't plastic.  This stuff does NOT stick to the oleophobically-coated glass (front or back).  It is incredibly easy to separate this film from the screen.

The Invisible Shield has worked for a Nintendo DSi and the iPhone 3GS.  However, the surface texture of the helicopter glass of the iPhone 4 does not allow for adequate 'bonding' with the shield.  Despite multiple attempts of fixing the shield to the phone, the shield tends to peel from the corners.  Given that the surface is different on the iPhone is no fault of Zagg, though.  It just needs some other method that would be more effective on the long term.Alternative screen shields should work better than this particular product.Not Recommended for the iPhone 4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-05:</strong> I have purchased a Zagg screen for 6 different devices over the years. This is a product where it is absolutely essential that you read and follow the instructions completely. Most of the negative comments are related to not following the directions or not waiting a few days before judging the finished product. Also, it isn't completely invisible - but it will look better in the end than a device with all kinds of scratches on the glass. Consider the alternative to not installing one.1) Install in a dust-free clean area (i.e. clean things up first with an air-can if you have one)2) Wet your fingers gernerously with the spray provided.3) Wait. Once installed it takes a few (2-3) days for the air bubbles to disappear. It will be worth it in the end.4) If you purchase the front and back cover. Install the back first. It will give you some experience when installing the front.5) Enjoy. I sold a device on Ebay and I cannot tell you how perfect the screen was when I ripped the Zagg off. It looked brand new.6) Touch is not significantly affected. I use a stylus tip and my finger with no problems. A little oil from your finger reduces most of the friction.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-17:</strong> This product protects my iPhone 4 very well.it does get dirty after a few months and corners start to come off, but with the lifetime warranty, I'm not worried.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-11:</strong> Good protection for my hubbies iphone, even as a construction man this works.

I even had the last one professional installed by the Zagg Kiosk worker at the mall and it too failed. The problem for me is not the installation, but the consist dents or bubbles that appear out of nowhere. I am patient and wait over 24 hours before I use my phone each time after installation. After a few weeks or days, you will start to notice indentations from everyday use that won't disappear. This degrades the quality of the screen. Don't waste your money on this Gimmick. You are throwing your money away. I don't mind the orange peal effect, but the thing can't seem to stay on. I had the front and back by itself with no case and it came off after 3 weeks at the corners. I then had Zagg send me a free replacement (+$shipping) and also got my free bumper from Apple and after a few days it faired better. The corners did not peal off like the first time, but after a few days, I had these dents that did not go away. Then I went to the Kiosk and bought another new Zagg and had them "professionally" install the front and back (for a fee), and again after about 1 week of very light use, I got dents. I've given up on Zagg and feel embarrassed for wasting my money on this. I'm waiting for my new Otter Box defender to come in the mail and I will toss this Zagg in the trash for the final time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-17:</strong> Its really good quality.

First of all, they give you plenty of solution to do the job right. You must get your fingers wet, and BOTH sides of the protector wet before applying. And yes, you must have your phone off because you are going to be squeegeeing the solution out. I use a tissue pushed into the speaker hole to prevent solution from getting in.The scratch resistance of this thing is remarkable. I have been able to keep one of these on for much longer than other screen protectors. Also, it has a LIFETIME warranty. You pay only shipping each time you want to replace with a new one.I agree that there is a very slight waviness in the surface of the shield, but it does not affect the clarity of the screen.I agree that it is not as slippery as the glass screen, but I found that wiping the surface against my cotton shirt or pants has made it much smoother in just a few days.I purchased the custom back with a family photo printed into the shield. It really customizes the phone.One downside about the fit, is that Zagg has made it so precise to fit right up to the edges of the phone, that when I installed the Apple bumper onto it, it was really tricky to get the bumper to settle down on top of the edge of the shield. Squeezing the bumper sometimes puts a slight bubble on the edge that I have to push down periodically.All in all, I like this screen protector, and I like the idea that I can continually get more for shipping charges only as the screen becomes worn.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-06:</strong> I used zagg couple years ago when it was the only one available for iphone protection.But now as we have lots of them for comparison,i didn't like this at all.The front screen protector is not at all invisible.I wanted some thing sharp ,but this is loose and saggy.I mean the screen protector while squeezing the liquid sags and increase in size,so the out of shape when applying.Moreover when back light is not ON,you can see a wave kind of plastic film on the screen.I will post the pictures real soon.But i never recommend this to a friend.I feel my friends Bodyguardz are much better and crisp then this.I should have listened to other reviewers.My BAD.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-26:</strong> When i got this product, it was new yes, how ever it wasn't really the sellers fault i accidently got the dry full body it stuck to everything so i didn't even get to use it, it was a waste of money.......</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003QXNA28" id="B003QXNA28-review28" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-27:</strong> excellent protection w/o feeling too bulky.

Provides good protection and does decrease the amount of fingerprints that the screen can attract.For those who are undecided: Dry and wet installations offer the same protection/look. Although, dry is a lot quicker and easier to put on, it is a lot less flexible in terms of removing it or moving it around. If you mess up on a dry installation, that&#8217;s it.

Given its low price, though, it's a great value, though I can see why some RAZR and PEBL boxes include this for *free*. My report card:Design: A-, nice simple design. Buttons are few and easy to use, though the main button is a bit sensitive. Single-tap to power-on  is a welcome feature. USB charging a real plus.Aesthetics: A-, it's attractive in its minimalist aesthetic. Color options are cool. (And there more of then if you shop elsewhere!)Build quality: A, it's a solid unit with good materials.Comfort: B+, it's lightweight with a decent ear clip. Unfortunately, the earclip is loose on the headset which, combined with the light weight, make for a very "floppy" fit.Compatibility: A, no problems pairing. Connects quickly when turned on. Headset has full handsfree functionality that is very easy to use.Outbound sound quality: B, callers can hear me fairly well, but many have complained of a pronounced "speakerphone" effect requiring some self-repeating. OK noise cancellation.Inbound sound quality: B+, volume is more than adequate, but could be a tad bit louder still for noisy environments. Incoming voices are clear but could use some bass. Minimal static.PS: A previous reviewer believed that, like the HS850 with its folding mic boom (the on/off and connection switch), you need only turn on the H500 when receiving a call; the headset would connect quickly with the phone and pick up the call. THIS IS FALSE. You must leave the H500 turned on and actively connected to your phone in order to use it, just like any other headset.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0006HTZ80" id="B0006HTZ80-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-02:</strong> I bought this Bluetooth as a back-up for my pretty pink Motorola H500. Therefore, I placed it in the drawer until I needed a replacement, and last night i needed it. I plugged it up for a couple of hours and tried to pair it to my new phone and it did not work. I then charged it overnight and again tried to pair it and nothing (not one indicator light). I plugged the blue-tooth back into to the charger, it had a steady blue light and i tried pairing it to my phone while it was on the charger and it worked; unfortunately, i can not walk around with a charger and outlet attached to my head. Consequently, this was a lemon and due to the months passed from my internet purchase, i am unable to return it or exchange.Therefore, the moral of the story is to test everything you purchase from the internet. I learned a valuable lesson.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0006HTZ80" id="B0006HTZ80-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-28:</strong> The device was not as the description.

Pink one for the lady and grey for me.Voice quality, both incoming and outgoing is excellent.  So light, you can wear it for hours w.o. a problem - you forget it is there.  Volume is definitely loud - but can be adjusted, if you want.We are using it w. SE r520m phones - first generation ("years" ago) that had BT built-in.I had bought a Cardo "Allways" head set in 12/03.  It was so cumbersome, neither of us really used it. It was uncomfortable.I can see I'll be using this most of the day.  I am a heavy cel phone user - 2000 min./mo. - mostly day time.I find it strange in reading reviews of these items that some find a model to be quite good in a feature (eg. volume) and others find the same model unacceptable.  Since no two people have the same size OR shape ears, probably a headset should be tried on for fit before purchase - just like you would a pair of shoes....mt</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0006HTZ80" id="B0006HTZ80-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-04-05:</strong> The price of bluetooth devices has gone down dramatically that I was able to justify buying one:)  The H500 works fine with our LG Shine.  Although you may need to talk a little louder so that the other person can clearly understand you (Well, not too bad really).It was an easy setup.  The device itself looks fine, not too dorky in my opinion. It also has a nice blue LED light. Available in many colors of choice.Why not 3 stars?  The volume control is hardly palpable.  It is hard to adjust the volume while in use.  Your fingers may tend to slipped while trying to adjust.  Even the call button is difficult to press.I like the ear hook can be flipped to be used either on your left or right ear.  It is also not too heavy to be worn comfortable on your ear.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0006HTZ80" id="B0006HTZ80-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2008-07-14:</strong> I bought an H500 a few years ago when it first came out. It was plagued with low volume and poor connection. After using a nokia bluetooth for the last year I got this one again because of the no cell phone laws in California as of July 1st.This headset is plenty loud with my Sony Ericsson T650i and I haven't had it drop the bluetooth connection yet. The volume sits a little below half and I can hear perfectly in the car. Battery life rocks and voice clarity is a lot better than I remembered it with the first H500.4 out of 5 stars because the ear clip is flimsy and doesn't allow the H500 to sit tightly against your ear. So if you're planning on using this while running or during an intense walk - don't count on it.Definitely recommend this as a great bluetooth device.

It's small, very lightweight, and comfortable. It's hard to judge the comfort of this device unless you try it yourself because everyone's ear and head are different.I'm using it with a Motorola Razr V3m from Verizon. It paired easily and quickly. The connection is a little crackly even right next to the phone, which surprised me, but it's not so bad that it takes away from a conversation. Naturally, the further you get from your phone the reception deteriorates. Volume and clarity are fine and sound just like holding my phone up to my ear.Overall it's a good headset and fine for my purposes. Only a few drawbacks: the volume and call buttons are a little hard to manipulate, and it would be nice if the unit could be held tighter against my head.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B0006HTZ80', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B0006HTZ80', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B00CFQRGK4</h2>    <p class="price"> $B00CFQRGK4</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I had previously used this brand of protectors (I think) on my HTC Titan and enjoyed it. I also noticed the fuzziness there, but I think the lower screen resolution made it so it wasn't so bad. The glare reduction was greatly needed and I quickly got used to the not-as-sharp appearance on the Titan, so I thought the same would happen on the 920. I was wrong.

I'm happy to finally have a clear screen cover that works. For the past two years I wouldn't even try them, using only the anti-glare covers. Then I would get tired of the anti-glare covers because in my opinion they detracted from the attractiveness of the screen.This cover looks great; you have to look real close to even realize there is a cover on there (wasn't the case with previous clear covers I had used). Boxwave sent me cleaning supplies with the two covers - that made it very easy to apply without getting any dust caught in between. And finally, finger prints do not show up as readily as they do when there is no cover.Nice screen cover. Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B000652QNS" id="B000652QNS-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> The order was delivered on time and the clear touch is nice fit for my Galaxy S4.

My Note 3 does not look or feel like I have a protector in it.They include a stick on cover for the Home button because the screen protector is thicker than what we're use to but I found it wasnt needed as the button was easy to find and push.I have a dusty 250 year old house so I went in the bathroom and turned on the hot shower for a few minutes to get some humidity into the air and knock the dust down.  Not too much as you don't want your screen to fog up but enough so you can feel the humidity.Then I was able to install the screen protector without a spec of dust.

I installed the protector per the instructions, even wore rubber gloves to avoid finger prints. It went on almost flawlessly, the hole around the home/jellybean button is a little big, getting it centered was a chore... though I managed.Next day, I put my Note 3 in a loose sweatpants pocket, lounged around a bit. When I pulled the phone out of my pocket, I noticed the edges lifting up. I pressed them out, but it happened again, only now I have a bubble in one of the upper corners that cannot be pressed out. I don't believe the adhesive on this protector is very strong.Also, the raised home button sticker is a little long and will overlap the chrome boarder of the button...also if you lie the phone face down on a table out of case, the sticker is raised enough to activate the button...I image this could happen in a pocket as well(?).Ordering a different brand, hopefully this isn't a common flaw with glass screen protectors.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-19:</strong> I've had my Note 3 Tech Armor glass protector for a couple months now and it was my first ever glass shield.

But with a little moisture and a non abrasive cloth, they washed off. I have even dropped my phone on concrete.

Amazon seems to be allowing companies to combine the reviews for their various products, which causes confusion and is misleading.  One of the reasons I chose this product is because the 'featured, most-helpful' review stated that it comes with 3 protectors in case you break one during installation.  Luckily, I had no problems installing it on my Samsung Note 3, because it only came with ONE protector, a screen cleansing wipe, cloth and little tool for squeezing out any bubbles.  It turns out the review was for a different screen protector.It works great with my phone - have had no problems with screen sensitivity using my finger or my stylus, so I sent the link directly from my orders page to my son for his Note 3 phone.  He ordered it straight away and his order came as a typical HD plastic (not glass) screen protector in a pack of 3.So far, happy with the product, but be sure to double check which product you are actually ordering and read the reviews carefully.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-19:</strong> I ruined at the first one.

Sure, it makes your screen a bit grainy, but you no longer see fingerprints every time you get done handling your phone. No smears, no stains, no oil marks from your greasy face being plastered on the screen while on a phone call. Good quality screen protector, too. Not your average onion-paper thin super thin plastic.

After trying the first two protectors with dust/lint remaining underneath, my third try turned out the best, even if some small dust particles are clearly there underneath. I guess you would need to work in a perfect, sterile vacuum, in order to get the clean application seen in the video. At least my phone's screen is now well protected. I hope you have better luck than I did.Update 3/2/14 ----- Downgraded to one star.I should have just used clear wrapping tape from the beginning and saved time and money.The ONLY good thing about this Protector is the thick gauge.Does not permit the stylus to move smoothly on the screen.It is impossible to get rid of the dust particles beneath protector.I decided to throw away this useless product, and trust that the original  (stronger than gorilla glass) Samsung screen will be enough to withstand scratches, especially with a "wallet case" that protects the phone's screen.

It was really easy to use and easily cleared out any bubbles.  I was really happy about that.  I had these ready to use before I even got the phone.  Not having turned it on and went straight for the screen protector - it was all I knew.  It does an excellent job of keeping finger prints off the screen.  There is a trade off, however, in that to give you the smudge protection and the anti-glare features, it has a matte finish.  I don't use my phone outside much so it doesn't make much sense for me to use this.  The screen has to be angled perfectly for you to get a somewhat clear view of the screen and even at that, there is some distortion on the screen.  Curious, I peeled back and noticed the unfiltered view of the screen - way better - the way the mft intended.  So, I decided to remove it and have enjoyed the phone so much more.  I'll be getting a crystal clear protector instead and returning this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-01:</strong> I never installed a screen protector so easily in my life!!

I really cant stand using my finger or pen on bare glass.  It really blurs out and stops reflections well.  The Note 3 pen works just fine with this protector.Con:  A sparkly grainy effect that is hard to describe.  You see this mostly with white screens like using a web browser and it seems to be common in all anti-glare screens.  This causes a slight loss of detail, and a sort of color shimmering as you move the device slightly, even tiny movements make this happen.  I believe they use very tiny grains of sand or something similar to spread out the light, thus reducing glare.  It's a trade off, I can put up with the shimmering, its not that bad.  Putting on any screen protector can be challenging.  Use some clear tape to dab the areas that have tiny specks of dust.  The bubbles without dust are no problem, they can be pushed to the edge easy.  You can peel back the protector and keep doing this till you get the dust out.  ignore the regular bubbles till the end, then just push those out.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F4A8FQM" id="B00F4A8FQM-review68" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-05:</strong> No glare.

It fits around 98% of the glass area, which is the highest amount of coverage I have seen yet. It lets colors through with no distortion that I can see. In fact, I can barely tell it is there. Due to its high amount of coverage, which I was not expecting, I botched the first attempt at seating a screen protector, but this was good practice for lining up the second attempt. The tape that comes with the protectors to remove dust/lint worked very well and did not leave residue. The instructions that came with the protectors were a bit lengthy, but very thorough in how to apply the product to my phone and do so perfectly. I did not end up needing the online video, but I think it is great that they offer a visual aid.My only complaint, and trust me, I am digging pretty far to find one, is the circular sealing sticker on the exterior of the packaging right over the resealable clasp. It was a pain to get that off without damaging the clasp.TL;DR? This product works very well and has set a new standard for me when looking for screen protectors.

The first protector (full body) cost $39.00 & within a week, the back (body) protection peeled off. The textured back battery cover doesn't lend itself to any kind of adhesive apparently. The screen protector had several bubbles that just wouldn't go away no matter what I did.Another (brand) screen protector was purchased for $12.00 (not glass) and it too ended up getting dust between the screen & the plastic and more bubbles. Frustration setting in!Then I took a chance on purchasing the Tech Armor Premium Ballistic Glass Screen Protector thru Amazon. The screen protector is the bomb, or should that be bomb-proof.Went on without a hitch. The protector literally glided onto the screen like magic.

I think they are a necessary evil for devices that will be used outdoors like phones with touchscreens and GPS's.  Thankfully you are provided with 3 sheets of the plastic film and some high quality adhesive sheets to pick up the tiny specs of lint that will stick to your freshly cleaned screen.  I threw away the first sheet after peeling it off when trying to remove its top protective layer after installing it on my phone.  The second time around, I got the sheet installed and the protective layer removed while keeping the sheet in place.  The installation wasn't perfect, however.  There were a couple tiny specks of lint that got between the screen and the sheet, but they are at the bottom edge and not worth messing with.If you're as anal as I am, you will have some trouble trying to put this on your phone centered and square.  I could not get the cutout for the phone's home button centered vertically but if you could do that, the sheet would fit perfectly. The top cutout for the earpiece, camera and sensors will not interfere with their functions.

There are many phone, GPS and other accessories that use this style of connection so I thought it would be useful to have another means of connecting the existing holders that I already have.  Also, I have seen some inductive "Qi" charging holders that use this connector and thought that I would be able to get one of those and use it with this mount.I received the mount packaged in a small cardboard box.  The quality of the CD mount is decent and the design is very similar to the Mountek design at a lower price.  While the plastic molding is not at a premium level, it looks clean and would do the job.  The fins of the mount slide into your CD player slot and a thumbscrew spreads the fins apart to tighten the fit.  I found the thumbscrew a bit too long so that it was hard to get your fingers behind it to tighten because it was nearly pressed against my dashboard.  I wish the screw length was a bit shorter.The phone holder device is typical for these types of generic holders: workable but a kind of klutzy in its looks because it is designed to accomdate basically every type of phone or device.  There are two "wings" that spread out when you press a button, then you can squeeze them back together and it ratchets in until it is tight around your device.  While it is flexible, it doesn't look very clean or neat.In my case, one crucial piece was missing: the ring that tightens around the ball to prevent the swivel mount from moving.  Without this, the mount won't stay on the swivel ball so it can't be used.  I did contact the seller (#1 Tech Pros) but they didn't respond so I had to return the item for a refund.  My quest for a a CD slot mount holder continues.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CLENB1I" id="B00CLENB1I-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-11:</strong> I bought it because I am tired of placing my cellphone down there where I can't see who calling.

I decided to give this unit a try since thought would be nice to have a spare battery for my T-Mobile Note 3. I must say, I am totally satisfied with this unit, and it has replaced the stock battery, which it's now the spare one.- Performance: The RAVPower unit is able to charge form 0% to 100% in 2 hours and 10 minutes. It charges at a rate of 45.8% per hour using the original Samsung USB charger. More precisely, it charges 1% every 1 minute and 18 seconds.Once I completed an initial discharge/charge cycle, the battery was able to last for an awesome 2 days, 3 hours and 31 minutes and still had 4% left when I took the screenshot. I gave the phone what I consider a &#34;normal&#34; use, meaning 30 mins talking time, lots of social network checking, moderate browsing mostly on WiFi.The unit discharged at a rate of 2.4% per hour. 1% every 25 minutes.The NFC work as the stock battery, being able to pair a Bluetooth audio transmitter and Beaming to my wife's Galaxy S4.Overall the unit is a great replacement to the stock battery. Initially I thought about just making the review and store this unit, but so far (1 week) it has outperformed the stock battery, making it my daily driver.* The charge/discharge rates data was obtained using the System Monitor Lite app from the Play Store.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00GY08C9Q" id="B00GY08C9Q-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-24:</strong> The juice on the modern smartphones tend to wear out in a day.

It fits my needs. It is a perfect match and fit, the quality is great as always from RavPower. Having 2 batteries makes it so I never worry about power issues. This battery charges just like the OEM battery and i think it lasts just a tad bit longer. The dock station is also excellent because I can just put it in at night and its fully charged in the AM. The only slight flaw I see is the it is a little wobbly, but I believe that is because it will charge any micro USB phone that will fit onto it.

I guess you could say I am kind of a smart phone geek, I have a couple iphones, and several android phones. I like both platforms for different things. I tend to move my sim card between phones frequently, and different phones require different size sim cards. With this adapter kit, you are covered no matter what your phone requires. You will want to get a nano sim card from your carrier, this way you can just use the nano sim card as it is if that's what your phone takes, or convert to a micro or standard sim card if required. There is also an adapter for converting a micro sim to a standard size sim. One good thing about these adapters, the place where you put the sim card is not just a hole, the adapter actually has a place that the sim card fits in to. This prevents the sim card from falling out of the adapter. If you're looking for a way to make your nano sim card compatible with any phone you may need to use, get this adapter set, it works great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G26XWDI" id="B00G26XWDI-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-29:</strong> SIM adapters seem simple in theory, but in practice you realize the very tiny tolerances you are relying on to avoid getting both the SIM and adapter permanently broken and/or jammed into a SIM slot - its very, very easy for this to happen.So, don't look to save a buck on a cheap adapter, get a nice one like this that is carefully manufactured - because unjamming a nano SIM and adapter from a SIM slot without damaging your phone can be very, very difficult, and a well-made adapter helps a great deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00G26XWDI" id="B00G26XWDI-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-19:</strong> Needed to convert a nano sim to micro sim for the OnePlus One.

These fit very snug both holding the sim card into the adapter and into the slot. they have a plastic back so the sim doesn't come out the back of the adapter which is where the added thickness causing it to be a little difficult getting the chip in. so long as you take your time, don't force it it should go in and not break anything. comes out just as easy. I have full top access to my sim slot (android) so your side loaders like apple or HTC might be a bigger pain in the neck.TL:DR this is by far worth the money, be patient and take your time and you won't break anything.

Every single kit I've tried is an absolute fail...with the exception of this MediaDevil SIM card adapter kit. I realise I probably sound like a spokesperson for the company, but rest assured I'm not, just an extremely satisfied customer. The following are the reasons why:- Nano SIM card fit PERFECTLY into the nano-to-micro adapter- Very thin film on back of SIM pocket to keep the originally used unit from falling out of the other side, something other adapter kits lack- Adapter itself fit nicely into my iPhone 4 tray. With others, I've had to manually shave off some parts to make it fit. These are right on the dot, or to be more specific, micrometer.- Nice packaging. In case you're not using the adapter, you can just stick it right back in its original spot for future use.For a product with such a simple use, I was really impressed with the quality.

Since the EVO 4G on Sprint, I have been using the Otterbox Commuter Case and have yet to be disappointed with it's performance.While its hard not to want to buy a &#34;Slim Case&#34; or &#34;Clear Case&#34; to show off the phone, I learned my $175.00 lesson on the original HTC One M7, when I experimented with the clear Spek Case.I travel for work often and being in outside sales, I am constantly on my phone, so protection matters.  Yes, it will add bulk to your phone and not allow you to show off your shiny new metal device, but it will do the job it's supposed to do and do it very well.I have had my phone for a week and have already dropped it twice, one time it slid across my driveway and the other it thumped on the sidewalk pavement.  I had the case on and both times it avoided any injury, it was perfectly protected.  For me the $35.00 investment highly outweighs the $350.00 it would of cost me in insurance fees for the two drops to have a cool case.  I highly recommend if you are looking for a great case to protect your phone.Pros+ Solid 2 Piece Construction: protects your phone all around+ Durable hard shell, even with the two drops had very minimal marking on case+ Otterbox does stand behind their products+ You have a lot more color options now if you want to dress up your phone, though I will stick with blackCons- As had been said by multiple users, the bottom right corner (the Micro USB Power connector cover, does not fit perfectly and does have a slight gap.- It does add some bulk to your phoneI was tempted and purchased the HTC Dot View Case recently.  I put it on and it is a very cool &#34;gimmicky&#34; case.  I thought for a second put it up on ebay because no way would that case protect your phone if it fell...I am sticking with Otterbox</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> I had a commuter series on my HTC rezound for 2 years. It worked great and held up very well to 2 years of daily use and pocket storage. This one for my HTC one looks just as good. Fit is fine. I had a cheap two layer case I got from Amazon, that wasn't too bad, but not quite up to the same standard as the commuter. This is a great case for pocket or purse carry.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-28:</strong> I had the HTC One M7, which was built like a tank. I dropped it on concrete and it dinged up the sides, but I never worried about it scratching. After a hard 9 months with that phone, there were a few scratches on the screen and the sides were dinged up.The new M8 is a sleeker, seemingly more delicate phone. It's 90% metal as opposed to the 70% metal of the M7, yet it feels like you could easily break it if you drop it. Knowing how I treat my phones, I opted for a case this time.I was skeptical about liking this case. I hate big, bulky cases, and thought this would be too big. As it turns out, it's just right.It's a two part case. There's a silicone slip on sleeve that goes on first, then a hard plastic shell to keep it on. It's got cutouts for the top button so you can still use the IR blaster, adds volume rockers, and has a "flip open" slot for the charging/headphone ports. At first I didn't like the fact that I had to flip open the slot to charge the phone, but now I'm used to it and it keeps it protected against dust/lint in my pockets, which is nice.Keep in mind - when putting the hard plastic shell over the soft vinyl, the case didn't quite fit at first. Pull the charging flap down (and out), and then everything fits perfectly.The case overall is very nice. The hard plastic is a bit slippery, but nowhere near as slippery as the phone is without a case. The phone is actually easier to hold with this case on it, and it offers full protection. I feel confident that if I drop the phone in any position, it will be 100% protected.I was skeptical about the front of the case taking up too much of the screen real estate, but it doesn't. You can still type/swype just as easy with the case on it, and it's easier to hold while doing so.I have the black case and the gunmetal phone, which looks sharp. The case is 100% black. My wife has the white case, which has a grey silicone slip on it. The white stays white and does not stain, which is nice.The case weighs 55 grams (2 ounces), and the phone weighs 160 grams. So it definitely makes it heavier - keep that in mind.Overall this case surprised me. It adds weight and a bulk to an already big phone, definitely making it less portable. This is the tradeoff, and you have to decide if it's worth it to you for protection or not. But it offers essential protection for a $700 phone, which is worth it for the sacrifice of increased bulkiness.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> Very good case.

If you want to see a video review of this case, or a giveaway, check out my channel at (youtube.com/itechworld11).I usually don't use Otterbox's because they are too thick, although I love having the extra protection.I decided to try out this one for my M8, and I was actually surprised with it. It actually isn't THAT thick. In fact, I'd say it's still a rather slim case (keeping in mind the amount of protection you get out of it). Obviously it's not a thin case compared to other hard-shell style cases.This case is also pretty easy to take in and out of the HTC One M8, and when it's on it feels pretty snug and nice in the hand. It has a hard outer plastic, and a shock absorbing inner rubber.On the bottom of the case is a flap covering up the micro USB port and headphone jack, but it's pretty easy to use still.The volume buttons are covered in a tactile rubber, but they still feel great and are easy to press. The power button and IR receiver are still easily accessible.Overall, the price might be the only thing I don't like about this case. If it goes below $25, or even $30, I'd recommend this to 8/10 people. If you're looking for protection, but not too much bulk, this is the case to get.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-28:</strong> The Otterbox Commuter Series for HTC One M8 adds weight with substantial protection for my new HTC One.  The little manual describes how to use the case and a separate little sleeve diagrams how to apply the protective clear sheet for the phone screen.  This screen protector is the weakest link for me because nothing I did prevented tiny bubbles from popping up as time passed.  I'&#314;l likely remove this soon, but do really like the two part case.  A hard shell snaps onto a rubber encasement with holes included for the camera, usb, audio, and power button.  There is a rubber covering for the volume side button, but the bottom usb and audio port has a moveable thicker plug which can be wiggled into the opening, thereby protecting the slots.  Should you want a lighter weight cover, you can bypass using the hard shell and simply use the rubber sleeve which will do a good job of protecting your investment and still feel good in the hand.  I like this feel better than my other phone's more gel like case, and its clear that this one will last longer because of its better quality.  If you need protection from drops or moisture or you simply want to thicken up your HTC One, I'd definitely consider this one.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-04:</strong> good protector case, a little bulky than some of the other cases out there, but it does offer some good protection. see my unboxing and how it actually looks on my youtube video link below: [...]</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-04:</strong> The HTC One M8 phone is a somewhat heavy phone and seems pretty durable, but I am a firm believer in the value of a good case, and the Otterbox Commuter Series certainly provides great protection.That&#8217;s the good news. The bad news is that while the Commuter Series is advertised as &#8220;slim and sleek,&#8221; it does add bulk and weight to a device that is already somewhat bulky and heavy.Otterbox is known for making quality cases, and Commuter Series for the HTC M8 is no different. The case is two parts: a synthetic rubber layer that wraps around the phone (and helps improve the grip of the phone) and the hard polycarbonate exterior part of the case that provides protection.The case fits well on the phone, although I did notice that the bottom right corner is off a bit and slightly covers the speaker grill.  I think, however, this problem will fix itself with use.The case also has a flap at the bottom for port protection. The rubber flap is a little hard to bend and inserting headphones or the  microUSB charging cable is harder than necessary. The good news is that all of the other features of the phone work fine with the case, and buttons are aligned perfectly, and the rubber flap can easily be removed with scissors.So if you are looking for great protection and don&#8217;t mind a little more heft, the Otterbox Commuter Series is a great choice. While not the least expensive case for the HTC One M8, it will provide great protection, and the case comes with optional screen protection to further protect the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-01:</strong> I adore my new HTC One M8, but it has three problems - one, it has a bit too much screen glare, two, the excitingly smooth and rounded body is a pain to pick up from a horizontal surface, and, three, it costs more than my laptop.  This case addresses all three issues.The case is three parts:- Screen protector - Comes with a tiny microfiber cleaning cloth, and an itty-bitty smoothing card (a credit card would be too big). I used some canned air to further de-lint my screen, which helped a lot with the install. I do wish the positioning tabs were clear, not opaque. I wound up with a bubble right under where the second tab was attached.- Soft silicone case - Has some nice structural re-enforcement at the corners, which is good, and puts the power-button in a little well, which keeps it from being accidentally pressed when you're playing Angry Birds, which is also good. Also has a flap to cover the power and headphone jack, which I'm thinking of cutting off, since it's interfering with using a charging stand.- Hard shell over-case. This snaps over the soft case. I had a little trouble getting it to seat properly, until I gave a firm yank on the above-mentioned flap, at which point everything snapped into place.Overall, the case makes it much easier to grip and pick up the phone, in addition to making me much less afraid of dropping it. I should note that the case doesn't cover the lenses or the speakers, so it doesn't provide 100% protection. For my purposes I'm happy with it, and in fact I prefer it to the Otterbox Defender series case, which I have also reviewed.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> The HTC One M8 is one of the best looking phones on the market, so having the need to protect it with a case of this caliber is a real shame. Still, if you need a level of protection above a simple TPU case without the need for weatherproofing like on the Defender series, then this is a good option. Additionally, since this is a basic Otterbox, this is more for protecting against scratches of other minor damage, and not for a drop on the floor. Sadly, since the M8 is such a slick (slippery) phone, a case like this is a must have, but if you want something that will make your phone still look cool, I'd recommend the HTC Dot case instead.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-25:</strong> The Otterbox Commuter Series cases are much sleeker and less bulky then the Defender Series. The HTC One M8 is a beautiful, sporty phone that really needs to keep its low profile when using a case. This Otterbox works perfectly. It's attractive and well designed. The rubber is thick and un-gel like. The plastic cover that fits over most of the rubber adds extra protection and allows the phone to easily slide in and out of your pocket (unless you wear skinny jeans). There is a door that covers the micro usb slot and the rubber covers the volume rocker. All other hardware such as camera, flash, speakers and microphone are exposed. The case creates enough of a lip to allow you to place the phone screen down without the surface touching the glass. Otterbox has also included a screen protector that you can use or not.  The price is good for such a quality case but it's really nothing when you compare it to protecting the M8.Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00IL7BG98" id="B00IL7BG98-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-09:</strong> Did anyone see the evening news-feed where they were testing a phone in an otterbox by throwing it and running over it with a tire? I regret I don't have the confidence to try that test with my own phone.  You will have to do your own.The black case is very sleek and classy looking with a nice hefty feel. It slips easily into a pocket or purse. Perfect fit. Need I reiterate if you're having a problem with fit in the lower corner, wiggle the little tab on the soft case through the opening on the outer  case and it will seat perfectly.I've seen quite a bit about fake or "knock-off" cases lately.  Otterbox says pay attention to the four "Ps": price, place, packaging and product.1)Price. If the price is unbelievably cheap it's likely a fake.2)Place. If you find the case on ebaby, Craigs list or a flea market you're taking your chances. Buy from a reputable dealer like Amazon.3)Packaging. When you see the fake and real packaging side by side the difference is obvious. Look inside the hard case. Made in China is a dead give-away.4) Product . Difference in quality is obvious. The fake inner case can be balled up in your hand like a sheet of paper.If you're buying the expensive HTC One M8 it just makes sense to invest in a good case.BTW did you know you can "build-your-own-case" on otterbox.com?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00IL7BG98', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00IL7BG98', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B009EVGAVE</h2>    <p class="price"> $B009EVGAVE</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I got mine to line up perfectly in one try. Unfortunately, I did get some bubbles in the top portion where the camera is. I can't get these bubbles out. I recommend going into your bathroom and letting your shower run hot for a few minutes and then applying the screen protector there to reduce dust getting under your protector.

Cutting my phone bill in half while staying on the AT&T; network is the biggest plus.My place is a cellular dead zone so I had to use AT&T;'s Microcell for coverage which you can't use with Straight Talk.  I was worried about the service I would get at home without the Microcell.  But, oddly enough I get more bars with Straight Talk than I did via AT&T; without the Microcell.Switching over was not without problems.  I am currently using an HTC One X until I get a new phone this spring and when I initially activated my Straight Talk sim card I was able to port my number, make calls and send/received texts within a few minutes.  However, I could not access data without being on wifi.  I did contact Straight Talk's Customer Service and they were able to fix the issue with one phone call.The only bad thing with this plan is the data cap (2.5 GB month) so streaming Netflix or Pandora (for long periods) is probably a no-no which is why I am going to get a newer phone with external storage capability mainly store music.

Well, that's not entirely true. I actually VERY HIGHLY recommend you head over to Straight Talk's website to order this. It's cheaper and comes with free shipping. At least as of right now it is less than this. And you can purchase your access (unlimited talk, text, data) at the same time, along with enrolling in auto-top up if you know you want to use the service.As for the Micro SIM, it works as expected. You may need an unlocked phone for this to work, I don't know for sure as my phone is already unlocked.Simply pop the SIM off the card, pop it into your phone (with the power off), power up the phone and it should be recognized. Head over to the Straight Talk website to activate the number and you're done. You can't activate the SIM without either a credit card to purchase the first month of service OR with a prepaid code from WalMart.Overall the service has been good. It uses ATT's network for my phone and ATT is pretty well available where I am.Straight Talk is the cheapest way to go for unlimited talk, text and data (data is capped at 2.5 GB at 4G speed, after that you're stuck in 2G speeds, and there doesn't seem to be any way to add more data).Highly recommended if you have an off contract or unlocked phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00BD4BLM8', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00BD4BLM8', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004ANKSXC</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004ANKSXC</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

This item is very very reasonably priced - for the price it's awesome.Having said that you aught to know a few things before you buy. Firstly, it's designed to fit several types of phones, including mine which is a myTouch 4G. Secondly, the fit is not snug - it's a little loose. Thirdly, the case is perfectly smooth - no texture.Overall, the case works just fine and it cost less than a sandwich.Also, the case was sent to me via the mail so obviously it could not be tracked. Initially I didn't know this and contacted the vendor via email to find out why the tracking wasn't working. They responded and explained the situation so that was great.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004ANKSXC" id="B004ANKSXC-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-04-11:</strong> This case fits great on mytouch 4g and I thought it was the perfect case but as I used it more  I started to hate it,why, because it's like a magnet when I take it out my pocket all this crap get stuck on the case.

Like with all long cables, it charges the device more slowly than the stock charging cable.I can't say exactly how much more slowly, maybe 30% or so.  I use it to charge my iPad 2 overnight next to my bed.  For this use it is perfect.The 6' length allows me the freedom to be plugged in while I use it in bed.I have been using it for a month now with no problems.  The plug fits perfectly and the product works as advertised.It did seem to take a long time to arrive, almost a month.  For me that was not a problem but it may be a consideration for others.If you need rapid charging you should buy the shorter standard cable, but if you only need length than this is highly recommended by me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007Y7YV52" id="B007Y7YV52-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-04:</strong> My only complaint is that the wire is quite stiff, otherwise delivers as promised.  4.5 stars.

What is wrong with me? Moreover, what is wrong with Apple for only making a 3ft cable?Totally worth the purchase. Now I can read in bed or draw on my tablet without having to hover next to the wall socket. The connector is taller than Apple's, so you have to watch that the cord is kept straight or with enough slack that you don't put any additional drag on the socket, but otherwise it's perfect!EDIT (8/1/2013): So after about 4 months of use, my cable quit working completely. Not sure if the connection problem is on the USB end or the i-connector end, but it's dead. I see a some other reviews say that as well, followed by a "don't waste your money" message. Come on, it's a $9 cable, folks. I had another one for back-up I'm still using, and I plan to get another one again so I can have two (one for home and one for the road). Yeah, it's a bummer that it broke so I'm reducing my rating by one star, but I still got my $9 of use out of it in that 4 months, and my other one is still going strong. It's a cable, not magic.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B007Y7YV52" id="B007Y7YV52-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-01:</strong> High quality cord but not too thick.

I have had this case for 6 months and it hasn't affected my cell phone one bit, it has just made it better.  Being able to mount my phone on any metal surface (obviously non-magnetic metals like aluminum and stainless steel won't hold your phone) makes it that much more useable.  I like to use it on golf carts to count down the yardage on the course or on the fridge to have the recipe at easy reach.  I usually carry a leatherman multi tool with me and it makes a handy cellphone stand for when I'm using facetime.

The good long battery life is what makes this product stand out and it last about the same time as advertise. Voice call quality is ok, not great -- missing noise cancellation so other party have a hard time hearing you in noisy environment. It's comfortable to wear but becomes a little weird when laying down b/c the band behind your neck could get in the way.So what's good?- Battery life was good, I was getting 4-5 days of moderately heavy use out of these. Charging were quick.- Headphone foldable to very small size and come with carrying pouch. This make it ez to take from home to work for me.- Earpads for the headfone are soft and comfy.- Range is good but not not great. Around 20-25 feet I was still getting music, a little bit further out, music start to cut out.The bad?- Audio quality to me was good. Not great. But then I have really nice headphones that I&#34;m used to so this could be a little bias- The button on headphone do not have good feels, hard to tell if you're pressing them. Would prefer more soft plastic button.My Wish for future model.- Wish it was bluetooth 4.0, this would be nice b/c battery life would be even be longer and enable some other neat status features- Noise cancellation on mic would be nice.One last note: A retail unit was sent to me as a sample for a fair and honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-04:</strong> The concept is cool but it does not work as I desire it.

Usually wearing headphones can hurt your ears but this headphone is very comfy and helps you to have them on for a long time. The headphones are very light and fold easily so they are great for travel. I use this headphone at the gym, while I am driving or if just want to listen to the music. The headphone has a build in mic which allows you to use it to talk when connect with the phone or computer. The headphone can be connected to any Bluetooth compatible device. For example IPad, IPhone, I touch, tablets, kindle, and laptop. The design allows anybody to wear them so they are basically one size fits all.The audio quality is really good. When listening to the music, the sound is very clear. The range for the Bluetooth devices is about 9 meter. The battery life is really good. I listened 6+ hours of music and it will still going. The sound quality when making a phone call is great. The person who is calling you can hear you clearly. Connecting the Bluetooth headphone is very easy. Turn Bluetooth on your device and look for the Bluetooth headphone. Once the headphone appears (TT-BH-03) just click on it, both devices will pair and the headphones are ready to use.Pros:+ Sound quality is great+ Foldable+ Build in Microphone for phone calls+ Large button on the side (Volume, Start/Pause, Answer Phone call)+ Lightweight+ Comfortable+ Carrying pouch+ Good battery life+ Behind the head design (pain free)Cons:- No wall chargerOverall, I really like the product. You have to be careful with the headphone because they are foldable. I really want to give this product a 4.5 star but amazon doesn't allow it. I think the headphone is very well priced for everyone and I highly recommend this product.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-15:</strong> This is a Great lite weight headset.

This headset is a great invention for wireless listening.  The headset itself sits resting on the back of your head instead of the top, making it virtually unnoticeable!  It charges through a USB port in about a half-hour.  Then with a simple holding of the main middle button on the right side, it instantly pairs with your iPhone, iPad, Tablet - anything that holds music files.  Easy to use, you can increase or decrease the volume with a simple finger hold on the right earphone.  You can also jump back and forth through your songs with a simple push of the button or simply pause.Even at several feet (I tested it up to thirty feet and through three walls), the reception is very clear.  When I went outside with my iPhone indoors, the music signal dropped, but immediately picked up as I entered back indoors.  Don't expect strong punchy bass.  But, the sound is crisp and slightly better than ear buds.As a phone, it is also remarkable.  When a call comes in, the music simply fades out and you can answer the incoming call.  The caller can hear you easily as well.  Even outside with wind, there is no interruption of sound quality.  The headset fold up neatly into a small 3" X 4 X 1.5" felt bag for carrying.  This is great for outside, the beach and on planes.  Note that this is not noise cancelling, so you can still hear noises and voices around you.  I like the lightweight handiness of the headset over a bulky noise cancelling set.  Headset generously supplied by manufacturer for an honest review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-19:</strong> It came it a tiny box, but it was a folding headphone which makes it very compact.  It goes around the back of your head and hook on top of your ears so it stays.  I first plugged it to one of my iPhone dice chargers using the included microUSB cable.  I left it the for an hour and it was ready when I came back.Pairing is relatively easy. Press the big button with a symbol of a phone for a few seconds.  Blue LED lights up and the first sound indicates that it is now  on.  Keep pressing a little longer until the blue and red LED lights alternate, then you are on pairing mode.  My iPhone and mini iPad paired very easily.Audio quality:Probably, I wasn't really expecting much, but playing music was a revelation.  Sound is crisp and with some considerable bass.  It is clean. Very pleased with the audio quality.Phone calls:Phone calls work nicely.  It transferred immediately from playing music to phone and back to listening music after I hang up.  The other party can hear me very well.  I switched phones with my son to verify how it sounds on the other end.  It works great.  Just make sure you have the phone within 30 feet  of you when wearing the headphones.Troubleshooting:I had trouble hearing on the headphone after successfully using it the first time; this was after switching Bluetooth devices.  Music was playing OK, and it stopped when my phone rang, but I can't hear from the other line.  The phone audio only comes out from the phone.  Simple fix - disconnect Bluetooth and pair it again.Cons:When playing music at the beginning, sometimes it drops signal as if it is still  buffering.  But after one or a couple of songs, it plays great with no hiccups.I was provided a sample of this product, so I could use it and write my unbiased review.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-28:</strong> I've been using Bluetooth headphones going back 7 or 8 ears. Back then the technology was not so good and units tended to be big and clunk. More recently, I've managed to find something lightweight and state of the art of the "in-ear" and noise cancelling in the Sony Noise Canceling Bluetooth Headphones | MDR-NWBT10N W http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005MLPQPQ/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc;=1.But for situations in which I don't want to block external sound, such as walking the dogs, I wanted to get more traditional over-the-ear type blue tooth headphones. Amazingly, this product from TaoTronics offers great full-spectrum sound that you'd expect to get from something 3x time the cost. Here's a few highlights:- Great sound. I have eclectic tastes and list to everything from screaming heavy metal to Pat Metheny. With this you get cice bass along with accurate mid- and high frequencies.- No static. One in a blue moon, there a dropout of the signal, but most of the time it's lock on clear and sharp.- Comfortable and lightweight. The behind the head design takes some getting use to. But I really like the fact that this allows me to wear my baseball cap.-- Easy to pair my 7th gen iPod Nano.These days, with the great sound you can get through bluetooth, you really don't need to deal with the inconvenience of wires. If you want to step to that world, this is a great path.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-18:</strong> I received one of these direct from the company to try out. They have not asked for or suggested that I write a favourable review, they have left me to write what I want good or bad.I have always opted for ear buds as my audio listening device of choice, so I didn't think I was going to like these. I was wrong, they are really very good, not just in terms of comfort, but also in terms of audio and call quality.In the box you get the headset, a USB charging lead, a small soft draw string pouch to store the head set and a set of instructions.The charging lead is just a standard USB cable that can plug into a computer USB port or a mains powered USB adapter like you get with an iPhone or Android phone. There is sufficient cable for the purpose intended.The pouch has a velour feel to it and will protect you headset to a small degree whilst in a rucksack or bag etc.The head set is cleverly designed to fold in on itself so that it takes up a minimal footprint in a bag and can even be carried in a loose pocket. They easily fold and unfold and you don't need to be an origami expert to do so. The joints are all free moving so you don't have to force anything. They are light weight with soft foam padding to sit on the ear lobes.When I first had them I have to admit that I hadn't actually looked at them online and I was expecting something that went over the top of my head like traditional head phones. I must have looked like a right Wally with these on top of my head, pulling at the ear pieces and wondering why they didn't reach my ears! Then I realised they were to go around the back of my neck, but they kept falling down. This is when I had the next revelation that I had them on the wrong way around - well in my defence they are not marked L and R, or maybe I should have read the manual first!When I finally worked out which way around they went I could see that the frame is designed to sit behind the top of the ear to prevent slippage and they hold the ear pads in place. Initially it was a bit uncomfortable as I wasn't used to this type of head set, but after a while of listening to music I pretty much forgot that they were there.I used them to listen to a range of songs and the sound was crisp with no distortion and no hiss. Once I had memorised where the control buttons were on the right hand ear pad I was happily skipping through songs and adjusting the volume up and down.Next test was a phone call. As the call came through the music faded out, the head set beeped to let me know and I just tapped the center button on the ear pad and I took the call. The caller could hear me clearly and I could hear the caller clearly too, all very impressive. A simple tap on the center button again and the call was terminated.I took these out on a walk with the dog and I had no repetitive thumping of a lead against clothing as I do with ear buds directly plugged into the phone and no wires to snag and rip the ear phones of my head. I don't normally run around, but I did jog for a bit and the head set stayed firmly in place.I was very impressed and a convert to this type of head set.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-27:</strong> I got this to see if I could combine the sound quality of on the ear headphones (airfi32) in a more portable package.These headphones sound quite good.

I was sceptical when the distributors sent me these to test and review, but I am actually quite impressed on both counts.  They aren't real hi-fi, but for such small and reasonably priced headphones, they do the job well.Sound quality is not bad at all, especially for this size and price.  They have a good solid bass and clear treble.  I've used them for everything from Renaissance choral music to The Who and it all sounds pretty good.  They don't have anything like the depth of sound or real brightness of high-end headphones, of course, but the bass is very solid and the treble is clear.  There is some distortion at very high volume, but for my use this isn't a problem.The headphones are more comfortable than I expected.  They are on-ear rather than fully over-the-ear, so sound does leak out and may irritate those around you.  The neck band sits over the ears like the supports for glasses.  The whole thing is so light that it's not uncomfortable and, surprisingly, they don't interfere with my glasses when I'm watching TV.  I have also used them while lying down, and they remain pretty comfortable.Where these score really highly is in their design.  They are small and light, and the hinged back-of-the-neck band allows them to fold up and fit into the neat and very compact pouch which comes with them, so they'd be brilliant for travelling.  Bluetooth pairing is simple and the range is around 4 metres, including through a wall and staircase, which is pretty good.  They seem well made with decent ear pads and easy-to-use controls on the right earpiece.For everyday use I can recommend these headphones - they work well and are very good value.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00CANBF0O" id="B00CANBF0O-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> Got this headset and used it for about a full week.Pros- great sound quality on calls and when listening to music!- easy to pair to devices- very easy to swap between listening to music and taking callsCons - if you wear glasses it adds more pressure against your head(gave me a headache)than I expected- only able to pair it to a single device at a time- when I used it in my vehicle, I had to constantly adjust it to stay fitted on my earsOverall, this is a really decent unit, I will use it when listening to music from my iPad, or hook it into game systems for online play.  As those aren't overly extended periods of time the pressure shouldn't be an issue.  But for using with a phone, it will be a backup unit where I can only pair to a single phone instead of another Bluetooth device I use which lets me sync both my personal and business phones.  I can't say enough about the audio quality though - it was great!I did receive a sample for review and have been very happy with this seller! I highly recommend this seller!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00CANBF0O', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00CANBF0O', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B004K575E0</h2>    <p class="price"> $B004K575E0</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Another weakness of this case is the micro-USB opening is just small enough for the OEM cord, so if you've bought a third party charging cord on Amazon like I did and it has an oversize plastic housing end, it won't fit through the cover opening.  I remedied that by tearing and enlarging the opening with a knife - crude but works.

When I initially bought this, I had read reviews where they had mentioned that it was difficult to connect the charger. So I expected that problem. When I received the product after application I tried charging but the charger wont go all the way in. So I started trimming that opening and after a few minutes of struggle I am now able to connect the charger. Other than that problem this product is great. It gives a very professional look. The back side especially looks cool. You can barely notice the cover from the front. Power button is a little hard to press but I can manage that. All the other buttons work great. The best thing about this product is that it does not add additional width or weight to the phone but can protect the phone. I will definitely recommend this product,</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004K575E0" id="B004K575E0-review21" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-08-07:</strong> Very good silicone case.

This seems to be a common issue with the most recent reviews - maybe they started sending out refurbished batteries instead of new ones?</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B005NBE75K" id="B005NBE75K-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-15:</strong> I bring this with me if I'm going to be traveling far without much charging options.

I was not sure that the exterior buttons would work with this but they all work just fine and all the ports are accessible too. The extras are just that extras in fact I accidentally threw them in the trash can because I forgot that the screen protector, touch pen, and wipe came with it. All in all this is great because it not only protects the Ipod incase it gets dropped but helps prevent drops because of the firm hold young children can get with this case installed.

Another plus: no glow light, which eliminates unwelcome nighttime ambient lighting that some charge plugs cause. This plug is a bargain compared to others that cost up to four times more.

I initially tried MediaBridge micro USB 3.0 cables (since I've had good luck with MediaBridge in the past), but their connectors were too thick to fit with the case on my phone (Spigen Neo Hybrid).  These connectors are thin, like the OEM cable, and will fit even with a case on the phone.  They also fit snuggle and latch securely in place so that they won't become disconnected unintentionally.

Had this for about a week and the charging and sync rate were evaluated and definitely comparable to the OEM cable.  Good quality connector tips, although the plug that goes into the Note 3 is a few millimeters longer than the OEM connector, but it is sturdy and solid fitting.  The cable came packaged in the sealed iSmooth wrapper as shown.  Definitely a cost effective replacement cable that has a 10 year warranty - which should last longer than a smartphone or tablet.

And even when you first pull it out of the package you have your doubts. But then you put it on and WOW. The black rubber edge gives a nice accent and the perfect amount of grip. You can hold it securely but it will still easily slide into your pocket. The selling point is the clear back. It Shows this phone to the world in all of it's aluminum glory. If you bought this phone you probably did so for it's performance and style, maybe not in that order. It certainly is a beautiful phone and this case shows it off.I am a firm believer in solid protective cases, up until this phone almost everything I have owed has been wrapped in plastic with rubber bumpers with very expensive brand name cases. Most of those phones it never mattered what they looked like because they were just black bricks. This phone should not be covered up in such a way. Don't get me wrong, I do have a few cases for this phone now and one is a very bulky and protective in case I need it. For everyday this is my case. It covers the beveled aluminum edged which yes are a show piece but if you have ever owned anything with beveled aluminum you know how easy it is to ding, so I am good with the edges being covered. The other &#34;minimalist&#34; case I purchased, the beveled edges are the ONLY pretty parts of the phone on display but makes me nervous if I have anything else in my pocket when I put the phone away.Basically only the face is unprotected with this case. I chose a complete Skinomi armor and it is completely invisible so even the exposed aluminum in front has some protection from scratches.To sum it up if you need crazy protection this case isn't going to be for you, get an Otterbox.  If you want to show off the beauty of this device this is definitely the One case for you. Ideal for everyday and even dress up days. You bought a showcase phone and this case will show it off.

For a while, the case held up fine. The sides of the phone are textured, which add a good amount of grip. Also, everything lines up as it should (mic holes, cut out power button/IR, etc). However, after 4 months, the clear backing just dropped out.I've tried using super glue to paste it back to the bumper, but it didn't work very well...All in all, I'm disappointed. It's the best clear-backed case on Amazon at the moment, but the quality of product isn't there. Yet again, for $10, it isn't bad. If you're looking for an okay case with a clear backing, go for this one. But don't be surprised if the clear backing falls off soon.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C6POWME" id="B00C6POWME-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-30:</strong> Gave to my brother, who is not a fan of cases for any of his devices, but he now uses this one every day.

The case is exactly what I was looking for.  It hardly adds any size to the phone and makes the phone much easier to grip.  All of the holes/cut-outs fit perfectly even on the on/off/ir blaster.  The other thing I like is it makes the volume rocker easier to use because that section is not cut out but has ridges for the rocker.The case does not take away from the beauty of the phone, it compliments it.  The back is frosted, but once you put it on you can't tell.  You get to see the back of the phone in all of it's glory which was very important to me.  I didn't want to buy a case and then cover this sexy phone with some ugly case that covers everything.  Is howed the case to my wife and she didn't even know it had a back until I showed her.Other thing I like is the case will protect your phone if it falls and it does add a slight lisp around the front of the phone so you can lay it down and not worry about scratching your phone screen up even if it does have gorilla glass.  The back is also protected from scratches with the rear cover and protects the camera because it raises the phone slightly so the camera is not touching anything.This is exactly the perfect case and at an amzaing price.  Only slight issue I had and not worth taking a star off, but thout I would mention is a small piece of rubber still left on the volume rocker that protrudes slightly that most people will not be able to see.  I noticed it right away because i'm pretty anal about things like that but it does not take away from the phone.  I'm going to take a small pair of fingernail clippers and see if I can clip it off.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C6POWME" id="B00C6POWME-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-15:</strong> I didn't like the feel, and the plastic was pretty hard (which ment, to me, that it wouldn't be very effective at absorbing impact).

Also, I have to admit that part of the great-feeling Aluminum case is that it's kind of slippery. So, the challenge was to find something that gives it at least some protection, make it less like likely to drop, and detracts as little as possible from the esthetics. I'm happy -- almost amazed -- to find that this case really does the trick. The nearly clear back lets the nice Aluminum color come through, and the lightly ridged black plastic on the side is just the right amount of grippy. It does add a half ounce or so of weight and a couple of millimeters in length. Anyway, it looks great and feels great. It doesn't come with a screen protector, in case you care.  If yo uwant one of those, try Zagg or some other premium brand (cheap screen protectors really suck).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00C6POWME" id="B00C6POWME-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> This doesn't add more bulk to your phone and fits snug.

A few of my songs I have listened to on Bose ear buds and never heard details that I can hear with these.  One startling aspect is when there are backup singers I can usually hear each individual now and can tell their positions in 3D.  It's really amazing in some songs.  It could be that the song has to be mastered for headphones to get such a good effect.  I notice many songs the voices just seem to come from directly in front of you.  Kiss From a Rose by Seal is particularly impressive.  You can hear 3-4 distinct voices plus various instruments all coming from clearly different positions.  Even with my equalizer flat the sound is quite good and clear.I'm not entirely convinced about the noise cancellation.  Bose is a lot better for cancellation in my experience but these have pretty good passive noise isolation too.  I'll try to update when I try them on an airplane.  I do know if a TV is playing in the background the active cancellation only makes a minimal difference but the passive isolation is more noticeable.UPDATE:  I got a pair of QC15 Bose headphones for comparison.  The Bose have DRAMATICALLY better noise cancellation.  However, the detail in the sound and 3D imaging is clearly better in the UE6000.  In the Seal song I mentioned earlier, the separation is there in the Bose but not nearly as dramatic, and the sound overall is just a little more muddy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> I really like the sound from these headphones: it's a nice balance of bass, treble, and midrange which I prefer over headphones that weigh heavily on the bass.  The sound is great for everything from music to movies, but my only problem is that they are very big and heavy.  After wearing them for more than about a half an hour the weight really starts becoming oppressive.  They irritate my ears and head and I have to constantly shift them to ease the pain.I love that they fold up so neatly into their own custom pouch and that the audio cable is removable so if you develop a problem with it (the cable is always the weak link on a set of headphones) you can simply replace it.  You do have to really jam the cable pin in very tightly when you use them or one of the sides sounds like it's shorting out.  I noticed that a number of other reviewers had the same problem, but it is easily remedied by simply forcing the connection a bit.I really like these headphones - I would love them if they were a little more comfortable and a little more stylish.Cheers,ClairePS - It always makes my day to know that people find these reviews helpful.

Sound quality is wonderful, crisp clean bass, highs, mids and treble are all perfect, can't imagine them getting any better.They sound equally as good for Rock & Pop as they do for Hiphop.2. Design is awesome, they certainly are made well and look stylish while at it, and comfortable they are.3. They do come with a line cable that includes control functions and a Mic, have yet to test the mic so I can't give a fair review on it.Cable can't be tangled and it is a pretty good length4. Noise Cancelling works very well, you can barely hear anything without Noise Cancelling on, so turning it on makes everything go poof.CONSThe only CON I can think of doesn't even have to do with the headphones, it's the packaging. The "CASE" these headphones come with a soft mesh feeling caseTo me any headphones over $150 should come with a hard case of some sort, but I guess since they actually put money into the SOUND and BUILD quality of the headphonesthere was no profit or room to add a hard shell case, in which with Beats you are getting $50 headphones sound and build and paying for the case and I guess the brand.Otherwise, these headphones are great, beautiful sound and look.If you consider yourself a Audiophile, get these!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-25:</strong> These were bought for my son, who admittedly wanted Beats, but we hoped to teach him a lesson in economics by buying a brand we trusted and saving some money.  We definitely learned a lesson, rather than my son, as the sound quality paled in comparison to pretty much any other headphones we tried.  Logitech is a brand we trusted, so we bought them via Amazon without having a chance to test them out live, and what a mistake, I would not have been happy with the sound for $20. let alone for $100.Glad Amazon has a great return policy, as they are definitely going back.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-25:</strong> For many years Ultimate Ears is well known for its in-ear custom monitors that are used by many professional musicians. After its acquisition by Logitech, Ultimate Ears has gone mainstream in the consumers market and UE 6000 headphones are one of their most recent products. Logitech UE 6000 is a pair of active noise-canceling headphones.Opening the product packaging is a treat in itself. The presentation is top-notched. Removing the outer box reveals a high-quality sturdy box with its magnetic flap. Inside is a smart looking zippered protective travel pouch, a blue audio cord with mic & on-cord control, and a bonus 2-way splitter. The instruction manual is enclosed in a pocket on the underside of the box top. Inside the travel pouch is the folded UE 6000. The packaging is so well done that my expectation of the headphones has become higher.The UE 6000 is very compact and folded like a pair of sunglasses. The overall construction is very solid and of high quality. The headband is rubberized metal with good padding underneath. The earpads are made of soft foam (seems like memory foam) with good depth. The face of the earcups is glossy piano black with blue accents that match the cord. The right earcup can be opened to reveal the battery compartment. It takes 2 AAA batteries. These power the on-board amp as well as the noise canceling circuitry. The power switch is housed near the top back of the right earcup.The detachable audio cord is a nice touch. One end is a straight plug that goes into the headphone and the other end is a right-angle plug that goes into the music device. The on-cord 3 button control is made for Apple devices. The detachable cord means it is replaceable since the cord is usually the part that gets damaged first in headphones and earphones.How does the headphones actually perform? Well, it blew my expectation. It sounds AMAZING. It's clean and full of details, with very strong bass and good treble. I think it sounds as good as the more expensive Sennheiser Amperior and Shure 1840. The active noise canceling works great too, elminating most of the outside ambient noise. One thing I want to point out is that UE 6000 continues to work even after the batteries are spent, unlike a lot of other noise canceling headphones. However, without batteries, the sound lacks real quality and power, perhaps due to the the fact that not only the noise canceling circuit but the on-board amp is no longer powered. Therefore, in order to have good performance, you will want it powered at all times. Logitech rated the battery life to be about 40 hours.UE 6000 is a high quality headset with a great soundstage. It's foldable and very comfortable to wear (even for hours) which makes it ideal for portable use. The included zippered pouch is functional and protects the folded headset when not in use. The blue detachable cord is eye catching and may open the way for third party custom cords. At $200 retail, it's a great buy for its features and performance. Highly recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-22:</strong> I use the Headphones two hours a day seven days a week. I walk and jog with them. They have been flawless for 8 months. The batteries last about 30 hours for me. My biggest problem is forgetting to turn them off. Auto off would be nice. My cable control quit working this week. I think it had finally been soaked with perspiration to many times. Hopefully I can find a new original cable. I am using a straight cable now.

The music had great clarity and the headphones are very comfortable, which is something I am very picky about.  I don't think another headphone could sound any better.  Now for the only 4 stars...which I almost made 3 but the sound was just too good.  The cord does not stay in place and was very loose in my IPad and IPod.  The cord kept coming out and I would lose sound.  Sometimes it would only partially come out and the static was terrible.  This was a constant issue and not just an occasional one.  I would just hold the cord in place myself.  I will try using it on someone else's devices and see if it will be different but I don't think it will.  I may just have a defective cord and others may work just fine, I don't know, but again, while it is working properly the sound is awesome.  Also, the noise cancellation worked great , and the whole unit was very user friendly.  Even with the cord issue I am thrilled to have these headphones!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-24:</strong> When I think of Logitech, I think of functional, inexpensive computer accessories - I do not think of high quality audio.  Apparently, Logitech feels the same way.  "Logitech" is not found anywhere on the headphones or case, just the "UE" moniker.  They come in a snazzy box that makes you feel like you are opening something expensive, special.  The instructions are printed in English and the more chic French, but strangely, no Spanish.  Logitech is clearly attempting to present an air of sophistication around a brand known more for practicality - though I'm unclear why no Spanish given the French speaking market in the USA is largely limited to cajuns.Fancy boxes and imagery aside, do they deliver on sound?  I'm content to have my headphones presented in a paper bag as long as they deliver the sonic goods.  I am a reformed audiophile.  I began down the slippery slope of audiophile-ness yet caught my balance years ago, refusing to go further into that expensive rabbit hole.  I do not have a $40K system, but rather a $5000 system consisting of YBA, Meadowlark Audio and DH Labs components - Sennheiser headphones.  It's a very musical and enjoyable system, though I do wonder if it's worth the money.  Nonetheless, I know and appreciate good sound.The Logitech UE 6000 Headphones sound very good for their price point.  My only real complaint is that I found the padding in the headband to be a little uncomfortable.  Are the 6000 UE's better than comparable Sennheiser, AKG (Quincy Jones), Sony, or BeyerDynamic?  Tastes are so personal, I cannot say.  Many love Bose, which I find sound muddy and terrible.  There is no accounting for personal taste.  I can say that the Logitech UE 6000 deserve to be in the conversation.  I suggest you order pairs from 3 - 4 different manufactures for an extended home trial, keep what you like, return the rest.  A street person in Calcutta could be overjoyed with a $15 mp3 player while an attorney in NYC could be continually dissatisfied with his $70K system, lost in perceived imperfections.  In the end, all that matters is that *you* enjoy your sound system and the UE 6000 is worth your attention.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-10:</strong> Before I purchased these, I read every review and listened to them at Best Buy. It was the in-store experience of listening to my own music that really sold me. The sound quality of these headphones is very good.  I'm not a professional audio person, but a person who loves rock, alternative, with a little bit of everything else. I can hear lots of things others can't--like the compression on most streaming services and low-quality mp3 files. I'm very pleased with these headphones, and recommend them to anyone who appreciates the full range of sound (hi's and low's).  They fit around my head and seal around my ears (30 something white male, average size) and the noise isolation is better than the noise canceling on some travel headphones I have.I had to return the first pair, but only because I didn't realize the cable that plugs into the headphone needed to be pushed VERY firmly until it snapped in. This is a benefit. From that point on, while using them in my office, if I started to move away, and yanked on the cord by accident, it didn't come out!Great sound--that was my #1 reason for purchasing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review12" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-24:</strong> Opening the headphones was a treat. The box opened with a magnetic closure and everything in the box looked so pretty. The wetsuit zip case is really nice and has a place to tuck the headphone wires and splitter, so that they will not toss around and scratch the headphones. The headphones are very adjustable and comfortable on my head. The sound quality is great. I love the noise canceling feature which allows me to listen to the music at a reasonable level without trying to drown out background noise. It was a bit odd using it to talk to someone on my phone, but I think I could get used to it.  Overall I was very impressed. The one con I have is that the jack seems loose on the headphone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-16:</strong> First off, I did return these after one week. There was nothing wrong with the set. I easily overheat, and the seal these cans had just caused my ear to get drenched with sweat; it has to deal with the soft pleather. I had the same problem with some Skullcandy Hesh cans. I have not had the issue with my Razer Carcharias gaming headset since it uses fabric ear cushions.The sound quality may lack a little on the highs, but it does well on the mids and the bass. I attribute this to the mediocre noise cancellation. However, this is not bad! I prefer subtle noise cancellation because the number one complaint about headphones with superb noise cancelling is that it cancels out some bass in the cans. Just read reviews on the Bose Quietcomfort 15 headphones. Although the QC15's have far superior noise cancelling, they cause pressure inside the earcup because of this. I had a headache within a few minutes using them.I've always had the best luck with the natural sound isolation of earbuds. I sent these back to Amazon, and order a pair of UE 500 earbuds. I like them so far, although many people complain about cable stength and mic/remote failure. I bought them without the mic/remote as I didn't want that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-03:</strong> The UE 6000's were purchased right before I went on vacation to Hawaii.  I needed something that had noise cancellation and since these were just recently release and I had great success with theUltimate Ears TripleFi 10 Noise Isolating EarphonesI thought I would give these a try.I do not regret my decision as these have been the best headphones I have ever owned and I've had prior experience with the Beats Solo, Beats Studio, Audio Technica M50.  With the powered mode set to off, I must say that the sound is great!  Perfect highs, great mids, and precise but not overpowering lows.  When using powered mode, highs and mids are just as good but the bass is LOUD!  Overpowering but with certain music, I like the sound of it.  Also on powered mode, the noise cancellation works slightly but isn't very good at all.  I was willing to settle because the rest of the headphones have exceeded my expectations.  Keep in mind I listen to a wide range of music such as OneRepublic, John Mayer, Imagine Dragons, Macklemore, T.I., Avicii, Kaskade, and more.Also included in the package is a headphone splitter (useful on the flight when splitting sound with my brother) and a nice storage case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0094S36RI" id="B0094S36RI-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-27:</strong> These headphones are great.

Then I found this and thought I should give it a shot based on the reviews.  Bleary eyed at 5AM I put it on without any fuss or even a second try, it was easy and had no air bubble issues what so ever.  This film is sturdier feeling than most and seemed easier to align and apply to me and although your mileage may vary, I was very upbeat about adding one to my own white iPhone 5.  Thought it was strange that there were color sections for the top and bottom of the iPhones face but I also thin it help to align the whole thing on the screen better than without it.  So far so good after a few days with it on and there was a moment where it seemed like the film was reacting to something (heat?) and for a moment there were moire rings under the film but they did go away as quickly as they appeared.  The film is very glossy (so I hope the make a glare free or matte version) and it seems like there is a very faint pattern in the film that possibly helps with either the application or lifts the film to some extent making the air bubble issue a non-issue (it is visible at certain extreme angles and lighting conditions only).  I do not see this making the screen quality dim or darker at all as one reviewer stated.  The film is definitely thicker than others I have tried.For a no fuss easy application screen film I highly recommend this and look forward to getting a matte/no glare version if he ever make one.

It was at a great price. I love the sleek style. It goes nicely with my designer hand bags. It has credit card slots. I, primarily, bought this to protect my iphone 4s while traveling. I have a verizon phone and it fits perfectly. Highly recommend it if you want a nice, sleek leather-looking cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0065EAPUK" id="B0065EAPUK-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-03-30:</strong> This case is great for the price. I paid $7 for it. It's clearly not leather so it won't last very long. I like the magnetic clasp, and the nice amount of protection that it gives. I always get compliments on this case because it's so stylish. It's inexpensive, and does the job. I brought this case because I really wanted to get into folio style cases for the iPhone, but I didn't want to spend a lot of money on something more expensive that I may not like. The white color is nice, but not very manly. I ended up giving it to a female friend of mine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0065EAPUK" id="B0065EAPUK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> I would love it except the slots to hold cards are so tight you can't get more than one in and then it is hard to close</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0065EAPUK" id="B0065EAPUK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-18:</strong> very soft leather, easy to snap, I wish it had the plastic built in phone holder, but never the less, I enjoy using this case, have gotten complimnts on this.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0065EAPUK" id="B0065EAPUK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-14:</strong> I love love accessories and when I saw this wallet case I felt in love with it.

Some of them I had to throw out because they got ruined during installation.Power Support Crystal Film Set was so easy to install, I got it perfect the first time. It comes with a pre-installation screen cleaner and easy to grasp tabs to keep your protector fingerprint free.Then to top it off, it's lasted longer than any of the others! Other than a scuff in the lower left corner, it's clear as day after 3+ months in my pocket.Overall, I highly recommend this product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00264FS3W" id="B00264FS3W-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-04-04:</strong> I've used Powersupport Crystal Film on my various ipods and iphones over the past 5 years.  I've also strayed twice and used different brands (Zagg - more expensive, and some other, much cheaper brand).  Crystal Film works best, is not difficult to apply, and once you get it on, it will stay on and look like brand new for years, literally.  On iphone and ipod touch, the film is so invisible and causes absolutely no reduction in video or image quality or clarity.  The only way you can tell it's on is that the edges of the film (which extend to the very edge of the glass screen) are SLIGHTLY visible. But they line up perfectly with the edge of the screen, so they really do not look out of place.Installation is not difficult if you know what you're doing.  I strongly recommend you take 60 seconds and watch the video at the powersupport website - your application will be easier if you see it done and can visualize the process.Work on a dust-free table top with plenty of space.  For best results, have the following items handy:  scotch tape, microfiber cloth (such as what you'd use to clean the lenses of your glasses), and a bottle of clear liquid lens cleaner (a few bucks at any lenscrafter or eyeglass store).  (by the way, this eyeglass cleaner and microfiber cloth is really the best way to clean the display of your touch-screen devices and your laptop computer)First, clean the screen of your device by spraying the eyeglass cleaner on it and wiping it dry with the microfiber cloth.  Inspect for remaining dust by holding it at various angles and looking closely.  If needed, wipe again with the microfiber.Then, use the included pre-installation film - it's basically just a big white piece of tape, which you put on your device's screen and then pull off.  It's purpose is to remove any remaining fine dust.Then apply the crystal film.  It has a backing which you gradually remove as you apply.  Before applying, line the hole in the crystal film up with the button of your iphone, then align the edges of the crystal film with the edges of the glass display.  Gradually remove the film and apply, from the side with the button to the other side.Use your microfiber to gently rub any bubbles toward the nearest edge, or lift up a corner of the film just until the bubble comes out, then gently let the film back down.The scotch tape is useful for 2 things.  First, if you get the film on and it's not quite lined up perfectly - don't freak out - this can be fixed.  Put a small piece of tape on the corner with part of it hanging off to use as a handle, and lift the film off from the corner with one hand, use the other hand to hold the film as it comes off by the edges and to gently reposition it.The other reason to have the tape handy is in case a spec of dust gets trapped in the film.  Use one piece of tape to lift up the film partway, starting from the corner nearest the spec of dust.  Use a second piece of tape to remove the dust from the underside of the film (sticky side of tape touches the film to pull the dust off it).All this is much easier than it sounds.  It takes maybe 10 minutes.  Maybe less.  It's good to move quickly from each step to the next.  The longer you wait, the greater the chance of piece of dust floating in the air will land on the film or on the device before you finish applying the film.Once the film is on, there is no drying time needed.  You can use your device immediately.The film provides excellent protection and is extremely clear.  Like I said, you really can't tell it's on.I also tried a Zagg shield (another brand of film) because I got a new ipod touch and wanted to protect it right away, and the local best buy had zagg but no store nearby had crystal film.  The Zagg film is stronger - it's hard to poke a hold through it.  On the other hand, it feels slightly gummy on the device and clarity is a problem - you can definitely tell it's on, images and video just do not look as crisp as with the crystal film or with nothing at all.  This is not because I did a poor job installing it - in fact, I paid best buy to install it, and the person who did the installation has done this dozens of times and was quite good.  But after 4 days, I took it back, convinced the manager to refund both the purchase price and installation fee.  I could have saved myself from this hassle if I had just ordered the crystal film in the first place and waited for it to arrive.Of course, the film only protects the display, not the back or the edges of the device.  You'll surely want a case for overall protection.  If the case you buy comes with screen film, I suggest using crystal film instead.  It really is the best, and you're spending a lot of money on your device, it's worth spending a little more to protect the gorgeous display while completely preserving its clarity.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00264FS3W" id="B00264FS3W-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-08-22:</strong> I've tried every mainstream brand of screen protector for iPhone that I could find and by far this is the best product in my opinion.  It has the fewest air bubbles and lint problems during application, it fits most perfectly compared to other brands, and holds up the best over time.I'm not kidding when I'm saying I'm a perfectionist when it comes to screen protectors for the iPhone.  If I apply one and it isn't perfect and I cannot recover it, I'll peel that puppy right back off immediately and move on to another. I've gone through Kroo, Case Mate, Krypton and other "semi-nonames" out there.Power Support is the only brand I can rely on to be top notch quality, every time.There are a couple issues I have with most other brands...1.  Most other brands are cut just a little too large for me.  I want a perfect seal around the edges.  Other brands with a larger cut size allow lint to sneak in and make it almost impossible to center.  This brand is cut perfectly to my liking as far as size goes.2.  Other brands are too "sticky" and attract lint even when applying it. It's almost impossible to get the lint off of other brands during application. This brand, once you set the center  of the protector on the screen, nearly applies itself top to bottom once you let loose of it. Not much work to get a really good application.3.  Getting air bubbles out on other brands tends to stretch the protector, and once you've stretched it it's done-- it won't fit properly again. This brand doesn't stretch.Finally, I like the texture and touch accuracy that I get with this brand.  Some other brands seem to dull or degrade the touch sensitivity a bit or make a strange texture that is difficult to slide around on.  This brand is the best of all worlds.In summary,  I have tried and retried a LOT of brands, big names, no names, etc. This is still my first an only choice when I want the chance for a "perfect" application to the point that most people cannot even tell there is a screen protector on the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00264FS3W" id="B00264FS3W-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-11-17:</strong> Read the instructions very carefully and approach the installation like brain surgery. Lint and bubbles are major threats to a clear picture and it is very difficult to avoid them. If they had included five sets of screen protector,rather than two,I might have gotten one good one. Neither of my installations was clean enough to avoid being peeled off and thrown into the trash.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00264FS3W', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00264FS3W', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B005MIVQSA</h2>    <p class="price"> $B005MIVQSA</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Installation of the SIM card was easy and that's about all the good I can say about it.I have tested and played with many touch screen phones lately as I was counting down the days until my contract was up. Out of necessity I had to make this quick decision. The layout of the menu is not very user friendly. But the worst part is attempting to actually use it. I cannot scroll through the contacts without accidentally calling someone. Moving my finger up the screen will scroll sometimes but 'select' another, causing a panic looking for the cancel button. One time it was in my pocket just sitting on the couch and my child's phone rings and it's my phone calling. I looked at my phone and it showed 37 outbound calls within the last minute to their phone.I got rid of it real fast and I would not recommend this phone... to anyone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B004Z90V88" id="B004Z90V88-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-20:</strong> This is a decent phone for stand-in purposes when you need a phone but have a few months before upgrade-eligibility.

That last one is a big plus - simply connect a device and it begins charging, and it turns itself off when the device is disconnected.

There are similar units selling for more than twice the price. The S5000 is a sleek, attractive design and comes complete with a nice quality coiled micro-USB cable and an iPhone converter. This unit is simple and easy to use, everything is automatic, and the built-in circuitry is smart enough not to over-charge and to turn off when charging is complete. Just plug in your device and wait. Some brief printed instructions are included.There is a power button which you can use to check capacity (short press) or to turn the unit on/off (long press), but really, you never need to do that as it will operate automatically when you plug in your devices to charge or run using the powerpack. The S5000 has two USB output ports, so you can charge two devices at the same time. It also has a micro-USB input port for recharging the device itself. This has become somewhat of a standard design and is seen in many similar units, though most sell for more than the S5000.There are 4 LED lights which indicate remaining capacity when powering other devices or recharging the unit itself.  Everything works as expected. You recharge the unit using your laptop's USB port or a separate A/C USB charger (not included). Any device can be charged or powered as long as it complies with USB power standards (as most do) and this power pack has a full 2 amps so it will even charge tablets and other high-power devices.All in all, this is an excellent device at a very good price. In my tests, it worked exactly as expected. It is an easy 5 stars for value, design, features and performance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00EH3I13Y" id="B00EH3I13Y-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-08:</strong> Very heavy, very big, not pocket friendly.

I hate having to remove a case or whatever to charge my phone but I like to have it upright since I use it at night as my alarm clock.

I also had been looking earlier for an inexpensive emergency back-up battery to toss in my bag on days that I knew I'd be out on calls all day. This seemed to fit both bills so I gave it a go.I was very impressed with the weight and build of the dock. It's a matte black with a subtle rubberized coating. Even more importantly, it allowed me to keep any one of my cases (I have several that I like) on as I dock & charge. The "lesser important" feature to me was the back-up charger/battery. This thing will almost fit in your wallet. It has a decent snap on cover. It has taken my iPod Touch from dead to 100% in a little over an hour. It will take my phone from 20% to 100% in about the same amount of time. All this and on Prime for $20? Incredible.My wife was so impressed, she asked why I didn't get a couple more (my kids are always losing or fighting over their iPod touch charging cables). I just went to order 2 more, and Amazon actually had two "Like New" units in their Marketplace for $8 each!Seriously, I think anyone would be very pleased with this as just a quality dock. The added functionality of the very effective & portable battery charger makes this unit a no brainer and a really great deal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XU5YTG" id="B003XU5YTG-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-09-20:</strong> This is a good looking and simple charging dock for my bedside table, and the inclusion of the extra battery is a definite plus. However, it is very difficult to plug in the iphone4 even after months of daily use. The angle of the dock connector makes it difficult to simple place the phone on the dock and I find myself having to pick up the dock off the table in order to properly connect it to the phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XU5YTG" id="B003XU5YTG-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-06-04:</strong> I don't have any problems mounting the iPhone. There are plastic adapters to accomodate different shapes. I have an iPhone 4, and it fits well without any of the adapters. I use a case on the phone and it doesn't interfere.The battery is an added bonus, but the phone charges slowly when the battery is also charging.Maybe this is a bit out of bounds, but Kensington appears to have a newer, lower priced unit. At $40-$50, I don't think this is a great value. At $20, it's a steal.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XU5YTG" id="B003XU5YTG-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-12-18:</strong> i bought this for my bf and have seen what it can do. this product is great for its price. we recently put it to the test last night while waiting 4 hours in line for tron legacy at imax. his cell was down to about 65% and he had brought his fully charged charger, this product i'm reviewing, and while waiting on line, and still using his iphone for downloading updates, playing games, checking emails and such, he was able to get almost an additional 40% charge off this lil charger i got him. that was perfect! so if he was just using it to charge it could well be above 40% charge. the dock holds both the iphone 4 and battery nice and sturdy, it even provides a small connect base so all the weight of the iphone isnt on the prongs of the charger. its very easy to hookup. i'd recommend this item to anyone who uses their iphone all day and find themselves with very lil left by the end of their night, and still are out and about in the city or just away from home for that extra boost of power.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003XU5YTG" id="B003XU5YTG-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-08:</strong> This item satisfied my need for a standalone charger for the iPod touch I keep at my kid's house for FaceTime.

Bubbles flattened out within a day, as promised. but the finished product was far inferior to any other wet install product. Obviously, it's inexpensive, but the savings wasn't worth all the orange peel and sticky feel of the screen after installation.

There were liquids, little tools, instructions and the protector.This was a totally different screen protector installation process from my old experiences when I only need to peel some additional layers and put the protector on the screen carefully. For this one you need to use the liquid to wet your hands and the protector which helped make sure there's no finger prints, small bubbles or dirt. It's a little bit harder to learn at the beginning but it's quite error-tolerant because you can remove the protector and start from the beginning by using the liquid.Moreover, you have to wait 12-24 hours after you put the protector on and before you turn on your phone, this is weird, too.Personally, I enjoy more the old and straight forward way, which may destroy a protector if you make mistakes but usually you have more than one piece in a box. This one is good too but a little complicated.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009VJ4VOM" id="B009VJ4VOM-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-27:</strong> protected the screen, but I dropped the phone and that's the end of that story...the guy at ATT told me I could drive a nail with the Windows phone....when it broke, everyone laughed that I believed that story...including ATT and Nokia...I'll never buy another Nokia phone again....their customer service was down right rude and insulting.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009VJ4VOM" id="B009VJ4VOM-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-12:</strong> After contacting customer service, I've decide to change my review to positive.

I've only had it on for a couple of days, but it appears to be as flawless as any I've seen.There were 3 things that I would say to other prospective buyers:1.  Watch the installation video.  It is very helpful and will make you more likely to do it right the first time.2.  Once the screen is on, it has a little more drag/friction than the regular glass.3.  Installation requires a good deal of liquid on your hands and the screen - since the Lumia's got a speaker at the top of the glass, you must be careful not to get water into that port.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009VJ4VOM" id="B009VJ4VOM-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-08:</strong> My phones have never been allowed to run around naked from the day they are new being I always sell my phones on eBay when it's time for an upgrade.

Considerably less expensive than a Zagg and I think it doesn't feel as rubbery and has less orange peel texture than the afore mentioned. Absolute perfect fit and like an earlier reviewer mentioned, this is the only type of material that will cover the whole screen due to the curved edges without lifting off.The price is right, so I can beat the daylights out of it and not feel bad if I have to order another one in a years time to freshen the screen up.Great product!!!!!!!!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B009VJ4VOM" id="B009VJ4VOM-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-06:</strong> I have used Skinomi's screen protectors in the past and have had the chance to compare them against other products. Skinomi's screen protectors are by the far the best ones I have ever used. If you follow the instructions they are a easy to apply and once on, they are virtually invisible and feel very good to the touch. In my opinion their best feature is their resistance to oils, either from fingerprints or your face. Before applying the protector, I always had to wipe my phone after using it to make a call and even then I would have to really wipe it to clear the streaks. Now, a cursory wipe and it is clear.Love it!

However, I'm pleased with it. Considering the low price, even if it doesn't last long, it's a decent deal. Interestingly, the charger I received looks slightly different than what's pictured. The main difference is that the LED light on mine is long and narrow, rather than a single LED point as shown in the photo. Also, the LED on mine is neon blue when no battery is inserted and a bright pink when charging. Kind of cool looking for a cheap device.Anyway, it's light, compact, cheap, and works. It is not fast, however. I noted that it seems to take a completely discharged battery about 5-6 hours to fully charge in this device.Overall, if it lasts even 6 months, I'll be fairly pleased (considering the low price). I may get another one as a backup.I would note, however, that an OEM Blackberry external charger can be bought on Amazon for roughly two to three times the price of this one (but would likely be faster and more durable).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001MEV8LI" id="B001MEV8LI-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-09-12:</strong> the battery charger may be good, and it's nice that it can charge the phone directly or just a battery externally.  buy a spare battery and charge it with this.  the light indicates when it is charged.I just realized that my reviews are the closest thing to my immortality.  this stuff is already outdated but my words will live on in amazon forever.  nobody will be using this device in 10 years hopefully.  maybe they will have fuel cells, or body powered devices, or brain implant so you can just stop using blackberry/iphone or maybe I'll have a personal assistant who carries my blackberry, phone, watch or whatever so I don't need to bother.

I wish I could only take off a half a star, but I can't, so four stars.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT1R3CW" id="B00BT1R3CW-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-15:</strong> It fit the phone well and provides some protection and a better grip at a modest price.

The included screen protector was easy to apply and the case is a rubbery gel which isn't complicated. This was for our phone which just stays at home, so it suits the purpose perfectly. If I carried the phone around in my pocket or purse, however, I would guess the case would eventually stretch out too much to hold the shape - it's just too gel-y. However like I said, because it stays on our counter at home, it works just fine.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BT1R3CW" id="B00BT1R3CW-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-07:</strong> The best things to get to protect this phone.

There is very limited selection of screen protectors for the Z Ultra so some other shoppers may be misled by the product name.I have no idea of the quality so don't mistake the rating for a knock on their viability for the Xperia Z.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DE0L3D6" id="B00DE0L3D6-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-07:</strong> Upon receiving this package I was very happy to see iSmooth continuing their inclusion of a very large micro fiber cleaning cloth as well as up to 5 dust removal stickers. Keep in mind that they also have a great tutorial video via YouTube for how to install the screen protector lint/dust free. Continuing their trend of excellent products, these once installed on my Xperia Z, have suffered no image degradation or orange peel effect whatsoever. Also once you have applied the protector you can't even really tell that they are there! Another excellent product from iSmooth. One nitpick though is due to this product having glass on both sides of the device, it would have been nice to see an additional protector for the backside of the phone provided as well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DE0L3D6" id="B00DE0L3D6-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-05:</strong> I got Sony Xperia Z1S from T-Mobile.This screen protector did not align properly with the camera.I cut a little on the top portion so that atleast the touch-screen part is protected.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00DE0L3D6" id="B00DE0L3D6-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-03:</strong> I accidentally ordered the screen protectors for the Z1 instead of the Z Ultra - completely my fault.

I really liked it though, so I took the risk and re-ordered with the hope that the new one would fit.  It did!  I love this cover, it's by no means meant to protect it from a drop or fall, but I knew that going in.  The flap does get a bit annoying when you go to take pictures, but not too frustrating.  Although the volume button is on the side where the flap comes over, the material is flexible enough where you can still push the volume button and it will turn up or down.  I also love that I can either bend the flap back when I am talking on the phone or close it and assure I don't face dial or hang up!  If the flap starts to wear down I can still use the pretty green battery cover by using a exacto knife to slice off the flap and wala!*Update 3/9I still like the case very much, but the connecting part where the flap connects to the backing is starting to crack :(.  I though it would eventually but not this quickly.  It isn't really noticeable now, but if it does get bad I can always just cut the flap off like I said before and use the green part.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-27:</strong> I was not please with this product.

This case is lightweight and it isn't bulky. I love the pink color. It keeps my screen protected when I put my phone in my purse or pocket, so that the other objects I carry won't scratch and damage the phone. It's thicker than the battery the cover that comes on the phone. It protects your screen and has a little thickness to it. It won't protect your phone from drops and spills. Overall this is a great protective case for on the go and I love it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-16:</strong> This cover is well made and does a great job of covering the screen.  Despite not having a closure, it seems to stay closed pretty well, and it does cover the entire front of the phone and keep it from getting scratched.  It is a great alternative to having a bulky case on your phone, but it doesn't provide any protection to the phone itself if dropped.  It does make using the camera a little more difficult.  The cover snaps easily on in place of the original back cover.  This is a great alternative to a box case or belt case when you want to minimize bulk.  The slight texture on the closed front also helps keep it from falling out of your pocket.  I like that it is small enough that it doesn't get in the way of most docks or holders.I would definitely recommend this cover to anyone who is looking for low profile protection for the front of their S3, but with the caution that it is a screen cover and doesn't give protection from drops.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review10" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-30:</strong> I got what I expected and it's a nifty case which doesn't add any bulk to your phone (which is already big to begin with, borderline Samsung Note 2 size. A positive note goes out to the distributor/seller of this item - The Prune Danish. I inquired about my order's whereabouts and they regularly contacted me via email to make sure that the item was on the way and if it finally arrived. Great customer service. As for the product itself, it's what to be expected. It's the same case that is sold in the Sprint stores only I didn't have to pay over $30 dollars for it (buying accessories at your cellphone provider's store outlet is as much of a ripoff as going to the car dealership for maintenance and repairs). As for the design, people tend to forget that you can answer your incoming or outgoing call and then flap the cover back over the screen and talk that way. If you want to snap pictures however, that's where there might be an issue since the front flap just dangles while you try to hold your phone to take a snapshot. Another thing is, if you drop your phone, it is completely vulnerable to a possible scratch or cracked screen. It's basically a battery cover with a very thin flap to cover the screen. So if you're looking for better protection, either get one of those screen protectors or look elsewhere. The case is mainly for aesthetics and it provides minimal protection if you were to accidentally drop your phone while texting or on a call. Other than that, it was a good find.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review11" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-11-25:</strong> I really like the case and it's durability, only one thing I didn't like...

When I bought my Galaxy I wanted a case that would protect the phone without adding a ton of bulk to it. The best part is the flip part of the case because it means that I don't feel the need to put a screen protector on it. Also, I feel more comfortable putting it in my pocket or throwing it in my computer bag than I did with the original case I had. The color on this case is definitely a LIME color which I anticipate will get dirty quicker than a darker case but makes it easy to spot! I haven't had an issues with the cover not staying closed and it seems to wear at a normal pace. It is definitely one of the better cases for the Galaxy, especially if you want a case with a cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-11:</strong> I purchased this flip cover from Verizon when I purchased my phone.

The hinged side is thin enough to work the volume buttons and the phone runs cooler I notice that right off the bat. I have dropped my phone with this cover on and it has done a pretty good job of protecting the screen.Now for some of the cons the protective inner felt of the case is prone to getting dirty just from daily use or being put down while the case is open while I do use the phone a lot more than most I don't know what the life of the hinge will be I have noticed in the week that I have had it there is a little peeling of the top edge on the hinge only while it does not affect the hinged edges performance its more of a cosmetic thing.All in all this is a really good product light, thin.

I knew it was used, but it should not have been re-sold - I think it is defective.  The design is ingenious keeping the phone slim, but there is no protection for the edges.

Plastic back snaps into the back of the phone as securely as the original backing. The front flap cover itself is sturdy but light and is cut perfectly to the shape of the face. The color I chose was orange. It's just beautiful and very distinctive. Prior to this case I was using the slide-in-&-out leather pouch accessory for the protective value. It was awkward sliding the phone out quickly for an incoming call. Occasionally the sides of the tight slider pouch exerted enough pressure on the side volume button to inadvertently change or even turn off my volume setting. This new cover solves everything including being able to speak and listen with the cover closed. I recommend.Today is 2/12/14 and the Amazon site is telling me that I have already reviewed the additional Yellow case I ordered therefore I am blocked from continuing? That result has caused me to come here and write an addendum to my original purchase of the excellent orange cover. The orange was so wonderful that I ordered the Yellow case for only $7.00. I'm confirming that the quality, fit, finish, and authentic Samsung manufacture with authentic logo and texture and packaging was the real thing! This is a $20-$30 cover found here on Amazon for $7!!! I removed from the packaging and fitted it to the phone just to make sure I was dealing with the real thing. I was! Everything I touted about the orange cover is applicable to the new yellow cover. Beautiful, original, and discounted to the max!!!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review42" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-01:</strong> Very good for my Galaxy S3.

There's not much to be said either way about its function that the picture doesn't tell you, but it is well made, and it may be just the case for you.When this case arrived, I was very struck by just how bright the color was. I must say, it is a very intense yellow, and may come across as a little much for some.  Regardless, there are other colors, and this is a purely aesthetic aspect.  The case itself is not so much a case as it is a replacement back cover. You simply pop off your battery cover and snap this on in its place. It's a slightly harder and thicker plastic than the stock cover, but I don't see how it actually protects the phone. It does, however, fit perfectly with no gaps, snaps on and off easily, and looks and feels like very high quality plastic. Earlier reviews may be referring to shipment errors, or just a bad batch, but my particular unit is of very high quality. Do note that this is not a true case, and in fact will prevent you from putting another case on it, so you'll have to use it bare or just with a sleeve.There's not much to be said for the flip cover aspect; its pretty self-explanatory. There is a rigid, felt-backed cover that flips to cover the screen. It has a vinyl-like texture on the front that feels nice, and it fits the edges of the screen perfectly, and the cutout for the earpiece is a great fit as well. The felt backing would conceivably protect the screen from fine scratches, but I doubt that in practice. I have found a good bit more dust and fine sand on the screen after having the cover closed in my pocket, some of which may have scratched the screen if not for my screen protector. The felt attracts these particles and presses them right up against your screen, so I wouldn't advise using this without a screen protector. It would be great at protecting the screen if you carried other objects in the same pocket as your phone, such as keys, coins, or pens, as its rigid nature obviously protects againt sharp objects or impacts.There's nothing fancy about it; no magnet to keep it closed, and your phone doesn't know its there, so it won't suspend or wake the screen when you close or open it. I do, however, like the encased appearance of the phone with it closed, and it folds easily to the back to not interfere with usage. It does a great job at keeping the screen clean when talking on the phone, as you can close the cover so your face doesn't touch the screen. There's a cutout for the earpiece, and the S3's microphones are on the top and bottom, so the cover doesn't interfere with them. However, its a real pain when you want to use the camera, as you can't have either the screen or the lens blocked, so you have to let it awkwardly dangle to the side. I must admit, I have yet to find a way to hold it when taking a picture that doesn't feel incredibly awkward.Overall, this is a well-made product that really gives your phone a unique appearance, and protects the screen in certain situations. Be aware, however, that it is not really a "case", rather its a new back cover and folding front cover, and is thus unlikely to provide any added protection if you drop it. The cover should protect the screen from sharp objects and big impacts, but again you'll still want a screen protector, as the felt tends to attract the very fine particles that can create micro-scratches on your device's screen. I can see it being a great product for those who think of their phone as a mini-tablet and like to use it with two hands, but if you use it in the normal one-handed fashion, or already have a case you like, this may not be for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review44" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-02-26:</strong> I have been using this product for over a month, and I am very pleased with its performance.

The protective flip cover is a great choice for those who don't want a bulky case - it adds very little to the thickness of the phone . It is very easy to install - all you have to do is remove the original battery cover and put this in its place. It provides good protection for the screen, though it won't provide any additional protection for the phone itself. Finally, it is pretty comfortable to use, although those with small hands may feel like it cuts into your hand after awhile. I personally prefer a case with a belt-clip so this isn't for me (and pink is not really my color!), however, I would recommend it to someone who keeps their phone in a pocket or purse and wants to protect the screen while still being stylish.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review49" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-08:</strong> I purchased the genuine cover for $40 and then returned it when I saw the Amazon price was so much lower.

The seller shipped the case and I didn't have to wait a long time even though it was sent standard mail. The only reason that I didn't rate this higher has nothing to do with the seller. I didn't rate it higher because to me the only thing actually protected with this kind of case is the screen.

This way it keeps the original form factor and adds absolutely no bulk at all.So far it's held up pretty well with about a week of use.The only thing they could add to make this a five star is a little clasp to keep the cover from flipping open.Pros: Replaces the entire back of the phone so it doesn't add any bulkCons: No clasp to hold the cover closedBottom Line: Perfect for those of us that keep their phones in their pockets, but it may open when rolling around a purse for too long.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review71" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-22:</strong> I like the simplicity of the flip cover yet quality and ease of use.

This prompted me to search on Amazon for a flip cover cases.Found this particular Samsung Flip Cover case for GS3, it was a little cheaper perhaps due to the bright orange color that isn't the most aesthetically pleasing to most people. However, I wanted something bright, so that it wouldn't be blended in and easily lost with my other stuff.This is perhaps where Samsung can never really compete with Apple i-series of products!First, the GS3 being the most advanced mobile handsets from Samsung to even remote complete with Apple, the outer casing is really flimsy - you drop it, it's over - hence, a cover (flip case or not) is a must. I guess, it's not all that surprsing that the Samsung flip case, too, is a little disappointing. The inside of the flip cover is made of cardboard material - are you serious, Samsung? Next, the flip cover keeps fling open - Samsung, can you not at least design in a simple velcro, or snap-on button/strap, anything so the flip cover will not, well, FLIP!It's sooo annyoing while playing my game on the GS3 and constantly fighting and holding back the flung open front flip cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review77" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-07:</strong> Like it.

I was disappointed, but didn't want to risk returning it and getting a different color, only to be disappointed if the shades weren't the same in person as online.The cover itself has been working great to protect the phone. You have to remove the back of the phone (the battery cover) and install the blue cover on it. It's great knowing that if the back gets scratched, I can always buy a new cover or just put the original battery cover back on the phone!The only inconvenience I've experienced is always having to flip the cover off of my phone and have it hang down while I'm taking a picture... it can be quite awkward and inconvenient.

I've had several people ask about it and even admire it. The case attaches to the phone via the back cover. Remove your current back cover and attach the new one and you're set so it's easy to put on. The texture of the front cover is nice and it adds an elegant touch to the s3. It fits naturally in your left hand and when holding it this way, the front cover acts as a piracy shield. anyone sitting next to you won't be able to see your phone screen. The inside of the cover has a nice soft cloth feel that helps keep it closed.Cons: My chief complaint is that the case isn't going to help your phone if you drop it but I'm just naturally careful that way and have never dropped a phone in such a manner that any damage was done. if you're looking for rugged protection, this is not the case for you. Also, the edges of the front cover appear to be fraying but it's very minor and not noticeable unless you're looking at it really close. this is due to the material the case is made from. Again, the inside is lined with a type of soft fabric and like any woven material, the fibers can fray over time. I can see that this case will not last four more than six months to a year but that's ok because changing out cases over time is something I do anyway. I'm just wanting to keep it until October when I'll be getting a new phone so if you're looking for a permanent protection solution, this is not the case for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review96" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-12:</strong> ONCE AGAIN THIS ONE IS OKAY = BUT I WOULD NOT PURCHASE IT AGAIN.

The front cover is attached to the back so you get a new back cover with a flip cover to protect your screen. The pebble blue matches perfectly with my pebble blue phone. Isn't that special. ;-) I also got the pink as well since it was super cheap. Now you have to like pink to appreciate this pink. Think Mary Kay cosmetics pink. I love the pink as well. I wish Samsung came out with a Hot Pink or Fuchsia as well. Even a purple; now that would be GREAT!I like the fact that you get a new back over with the front cover. If the back ever gets scratched or banged up I can always get get a new flip cover case. Not that I expect to be beating up my phone anytime soon. I'm just saying it's easily replaceable. I love how it keeps your phone slim as well. I can fit the phone in my wallet and not feel like it's ruining my wallet or weighing it down.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review102" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-28:</strong> For the price and how cute it was I got this.

After un-boxing my new case, i noticed there wasn't any instructions on how to use this case. Sadly, it took me a few minutes before I realized that this case replaces your stock battery cover on the Samsung galaxy s3. Once I snapped the case in place, I thought this case looked pretty good and slick. One of the best parts about this case is that it has the flip cover that will go over the screen. The inside of it is padded so as to protect your screen from scratches. I also tried many times to take my phone out of my pocket and put it back in with the case, and it was a smooth, easy process. The problem I have with this phone is that it doesn't protect the phone from damage that well. I am still worried that if I drop my phone that the screen will still crack or break because the flip cover will come open while falling. This phone is not safe from fall damage.If you are looking for a product that will just protect the screen from scratches or wear/tear then this case will be perfect for you. But, if you are like me, and want a case that also makes sure your phone doesn't break into a million pieces when dropped, then this product most likely isn't for you.To summarize, this case is very good looking, and wonderful for protecting the screen from damage, but will not keep your phone safe from dropping it or other damages.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review118" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-30:</strong> great case for simple use&#62; not for protection but for around the house&#62; perfect fit for my samsumg galaxy s#</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review119" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-24:</strong> In one word, look for other case.

It does'y make the phone feel like it has any extra weight added to it. The back cover snaps on perfectly. The from flip cover fits over the front screen perfectly. It does not have a magnetic cover so it does slide around sometimes. The cover also picks up dirt pretty easily due to the material its made out of. It would be nice for the cover to put the phone to sleep and wake it up and also if Samsung made thee two toned. Or the back cover the same color as the SIII and the flip cover in another color. Sometimes it looks weird with a different color back cover but it grows on you.

This case replaces the battery cover on the phone (i.e. take the battery cover off and put the phone case on). This is nice because it adds very negligible bulk to the phone and still gives screen protection. However, the disadvantage is that the case does not really provide &#34;extra&#34; protection to the phone (i.e. it is not a case outside of the phone, it's more or less part of the phone itself). However, it will protect the screen, which is what we were looking for. The hinge for the front cover seems durable, and the case fits the phone very well.

It's a decent design and it protects the screen well while it's on my desk or in my pocket. There are three problems with the case that cause me to lower the rating:1. The felt layer that keeps the screen protected started peeling at the corners just a couple of months after I bought it. I carefully glued it back on but it's already peeling again.2. The back of this cover, the part that replaces the back cover of the phone, is a bit too prone to fingerprints and scratches.3. Because of the case's design, I can't use a standard rubberized case protector to help protect the phone in case I drop it. They won't fit over the "hinge" that attaches the screen cover to the back.Admittedly, two cases would be a bit of overkill, but I wouldn't mind a design that incorporated the increased drop protection of the best of the protective cases with the screen protection of this case. You might be better off with a more protective case coupled with a standard, clear, stick-on screen protector.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review166" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-08:</strong> This was cute at first then the outside and inside started picking up the colors from my clothing not it looks dirty</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review167" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-26:</strong> Looks like the samsung, but does not wear like the samsung, so must not be the samsung, so be careful.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review168" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-24:</strong> I have had a lot of people want to look at my phone case after getting this.  I really like how you can talk on the phone with it closed and not get oils from your face all over the screen.  It is a higher quality back cover than the one that originally came with the phone.  The down side is that it does not stay closed or automatically turn on the phone when it is opened.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review169" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-07-11:</strong> I am coming from a physical QWERTY phone to the SGS3 so it is all still brand new - but the case makes things a bit awkward for use - I found flipping it back all the way so that the case is back-to-back with the phone is the most comfortable but that isn't saying very much.  It looks professional and indeed protects the front of the phone while in pockets, bags and holding the phone while not in use etc, but would have been more effective as a slide on instead of a back cover replacement or with a subtle latch or velcro closing strap.  Overall, I don't find the cover cheap, and the flexible spine seems quite durable.I was going to return it but I discovered a method that DOES work: flipping the soft felt side down behind the phone, placing something with decent weight on top of it, then just leaning the phone back to rest on the object.  This actually makes for decent viewing and function in landscape mode.  Just make sure you put a clean tissue or napkin under the soft felt to keep it from getting dirty.  Another practical observation is that when flipped back-to-back while holding the phone, it actually helps when using it with one hand and pretty much prevents all those constant accidental screen touches that manages to activate something you didn't mean to - the sensitivity of this screen is outstanding (almost to a fault) so this is actually a positive aspect of this case.  Not as comfortable if you have smallish hands btw.Additionally for those that care, there's no Verizon 4G LTE logo anywhere on it, tho some recognition should be given to Verizon for not being obnoxious about the orig cover logo (but that's for another thread).I am awaiting my Otterbox Defender case which should arrive around the 16th.***Update***Aug. 16th 2012This case has started to come apart at the edges revealing some yellow plastic card.

That's it. The back is an EXACT replacement of the same back plastic that comes from the factory. So, you get no actual protection of the phone from shock. You only get protection of the face. I guess I shouldn't fault the cover for barely protecting the phone as it does what it says it does; it just doesn't do all that much. I was hoping to PROTECT the phone from shock and drops, but all it protects is the glass with a rather flimsy faux leather-like covering. If you KNOW that it is merely a glass cover, and if that is all you want, then the case would be perfect for you. As it were, I was hoping for some RIGIDITY and SHOCK resistance, for which this cover provides neither (since the back of the cover is merely a thin plastic replacement exactly like the one it replaces. I guess, if you've somehow broken or misplaced the back of your Galaxy S3, then it's a replacement back that comes with a front-glass cover, and for that, it would be perfect. But, for me, I ended up taking it off and putting it in the drawer as it was useless for protecting the phone from drops and shocks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review185" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-19:</strong> it look good i love yellow everybody give complement. i keep this cover like new condition so of  my phone</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review186" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> Love this.

On the back of the cover there is only a Samsung logo in slightly raised letters that are chrome, nice to look at and not too flashy (keep in mind this is a LIME GREEN case, if you're not going for flashy you may want a different color choice, lol). The case fits around the port for the headphones and the charging port perfect, as it is a Samsung case, and the only noticeable extra "bulk" is the flap that goes over the screen"the flap":this thing is pretty great for someone who just wants a little more protection for your screen when it's sitting on your desk or if you toss your phone in your pocket and accidently put your keys in the same pocket. my fiancee pointed out that there really isn't anything keeping the flap closed so if you were to toss it into a purse it could come open unless it was in a pocket of a purse. When using the phone it can be a little in the way but the hinge part of the flap does allow for the flap to be folded all the way over so its out of the way, sort of like using a pad of paper.the camera:here is the only place i had an issue with this case, when using the camera. If you use your phone in landscape mode to take pictures the flap is kind of in the way, it's more of a two handed job with pictures now. If you are someone that takes a ton of pictures it's something you will need to get used to or maybe find a different case if this is something that might bother you cause that is pretty much the only downfall i've found so far with this, otherwise i recommend this product highly.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review192" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-18:</strong> I enjoy holding the phone in my hand while moving it around while it is closed, once you try to open it that is where it seems somewhat awkward to do because I normally use only one hand to access the touchscreen while on the go or working, although it is relatively easy to access while it is laying on flat surface such as a table or by using both hands. It does offers great protection and is a very attractive add on.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review193" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-17:</strong> Read the reviews mine came just fine fit the phone and did the job for a fraction of the cost.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review194" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-01-13:</strong> Despite picking this up for a low price, I fully regret the purchase.

It looked really nice but $39.99 was a little steep but I went for it.  It doesn't add any bulk to the slim phone, the rear cover is the same as the original and the cover is very thin.  However, it was difficult at first to answer calls as I had to remove phone from my pocket, flip cover open, swip to unlock screen then swip to answer call.  I missed a lot of calls in the beginning but got the hang of it.  The big complaint is that you need to fold the cover over to use the phone comfortably; after 2 weeks, the laminated piece on top of the cover started to bubble near the hinge area. The 3rd week the edges started to unravel.  After 4 weeks, the Verizon store, reluctantly exchanged it & said it was normal "wear & tear" and quoted a 14 day return poicy.  The 2nd cover developed the same problems after 2 weeks so I bought a generic "Aduro" shell holster combo case for under $5 including shipping from Amazon.  The holster case is NICE & durable.  I could have bought 8 for the price of the Samsung flip cover! The cover adds a litle bulk but adds grip to the phone since the OEM case is smooth. The holster which protects the screen is a definite plus! I highly recommend the Aduro or the generic from "WireX". At $5 U cannot lose.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review196" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-15:</strong> The cover looks pretty but it offers no protection to the phone.

But for those of you who are planning to buy one, here's to hoping you got a REAL samsung made product....I get what Samsung was trying to do with the flip cover and all.  They were hoping to make a sleek product that very much kept with the idea of keeping the phone slim.  My issue with that is that It seems SO much like the old palm pilots that used to have the flip covers as well.  The flip cover is kind of a hassle too since it isn't magnetically attached to the screen or anything so if you're using the phone then you have to peel the cover back and hold it in place.  Makes it very difficult to hold sometimes if you're talking on it or using it to text or listen to music.I like that the back of the case replaces your own backing so that it stays on better and makes the whole thing more uniform, but i specifically waited to buy my red samsung SII because i wanted the red with the sparkles in the cover.  Now don't get me wrong i love yellow just as much as the next person (fyi this is very much a sunshine buttercups and daisies kind of yellow) but I really wanted the red to be the dominant color for my phone and they didn't give me that option.The backing is made of a hard plastic and the front is a neoprene cover with some soft cloth to prevent it from scratching your phone.  I have to mention though that the cover as nice as it is, in yellow DEFNITELY gets dirty easy.  after only 2 days of using it, I can tell that it's a darker shade of yellow than when i initially got it.  The case IS as THIN as they claim it to be.  Which is good because even though i'm a girl, I hate purses ( I know what you're thinking, this person has to be a guy because what girl doesn't like a purse!?  I assure you I am very much a girl, I just prefer shoes!)The case does cover the volume buttons which is kind of a drag if you're like me and use your phone as an MP3 player.  if you want to check the song or change songs and need to turn on the phone, you have to open the cover and then use it.  the volume keys CAN be pressed through the cover since it is soft and pliable but it's not the same.Now if you're like me and the part of the phone you need to protect the most are the edges ( I can't help it I drop my phone often and that's what likes to make contact with concrete, marble, toes, table edges, etc) THIS WILL NOT DO IT.  It does not cover the edges at all pretty much.If you're careful, like slim cases, and only use your phone as a way to text or surf the web then you'll be fine.  Otherwise, you might want to look elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review211" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-11:</strong> To install this product you just remove the factory battery compartment cover from your phone and replace it with the replacement factory back that includes a flip cover.

My friends with iPhones were so jealous.  However, it is awkward.  When you talk on the phone, you have this weird flap.  What do you do with it?  Fold it over?  Let it flap in the wind.  It also gets in the way when you want to snap a picture.Design wise it is beautiful, but it is also hard to clean.  It is marble white and one spec of dirt will stick out and I have tried to clean it, but I couldn't get it removed.Again, it is really cool looking, but awkward to hold when you are using the phone and it probably will look fairly dirty soon.

When flipped open, the cover presents a hard, thin edge that's uncomfortable to hold and that interferes somewhat with both easy button access and a secure grip on the phone. The case back is essentially the standard phone back but with an integral flip cover, so the camera's lens gets no protection from this case since it sticks out just like it does with the standard phone. Nor does the anodized metal rim of the phone get any protection from this case.I haven't used the case enough to know if it has durability problems as reported by others, but the hinge on the cover is very thin and I wouldn't be surprised if it's a weak point for durability.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0089KJX60" id="B0089KJX60-review225" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-01:</strong> it is an attractive item but provides no protection for your phone.

The version for my S3 I have been using for a year and it continues to look new and also continues to maintain its integrity and its fit to the S3. The second case is for a Note 2 and it is likewise well fitting. I have only had it a few weeks but it seems to be as well constructed as the S3 version. Likewise the S4 version is also well made and fits perfectly. I like the fact that all three provide excellent corner protection as well as outer edge contact with the phone completely around the sides of the phone.

I took a chance and paid the almost $30 cost and it was worth it.  Now I have the S4 and decided to get the Ringke again and I am very please with the fit and finish.  It is so slim that the phone keeps its slender feel but get some added protection and grip.  The best thing is for the S4 it was under $10, so it's a no brainer.  There are other brands that make slim cases but I went with what I've used before.

Being that the S4 is already slippery I was hoping for a slim case that could give it some grip this one helps a little but not much.

I chose the Ringke Slim case because of its unobtrusive presence on the phone, the matte black color, and the price. The case fits well and all the cutouts line up perfectly. The matte black is attractive and does not pick up any lint from my jeans pocket. The case strikes a nice balance between protection and being very slim. It also hides the somewhat tacky pattern on the back of the phone. However, don't think this will protect your phone from anything more than scratches and nicks. I think it is unreasonable for anyone to assume this case will help prevent the screen from cracking if dropped; it just isn't that type of case.Overall I am very happy with the Ringke Slim and would recommend it to anyone who wants a very subtle, slim case on their GS4.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUUIOS4" id="B00BUUIOS4-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-06:</strong> Note: This case is really only good for a) protecting the case back from scratches and b) keeping the screen off the table when face down (creating a lip at the 4 corners).  It will do *nothing* for impact protection.-Holds the S4 securely.  I had this same case for my S3 and loved it then too.-Extremely thin.  I feel it makes the phone even better to hold vs. being without a case.-Excellent texture.  Matte finish rubbery feeling that doesn't slide around.  It's also *durable*.  My S3 version after a year still looked brand new (except for cracked edges...read below).-Doesn't block any of the mics or other features.The only CON is that this case is very stiff so it's a bit difficult to get off.  This is important if you're planning on doing battery or SD card swapsI also know from the S3 version that the corners will eventually crack a little bit from repeated installation and removal. Not really a big deal though since it didn't affect functionality or appearance.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00BUUIOS4" id="B00BUUIOS4-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-10:</strong> The case is incredibly slim, perfectly form-fitting and feels fantastic in the hand, with smooth edges all around and only the most minimal signs of the plastic mold.

It makes it easier to grip and still comes out of a pocket easily.It did save my phone from a drop already, mostly. It hit on the top corner just where the case stops, so the case took the brunt of the hit while the phone trim was only slightly dented. this would've definitely broken the glass if I didn't have it in the case, so it has already paid for itself.I change batteries often--almost daily-- so to make this case easier to remove, I cut the part of the case frame above the volume rocker.

I wanted it to be a little glossier but it does cover more of the top and bottom (near headphone and power jacks) than other cases but the almost matte finish kind of sucks. I have since moved on to a much cheaper 0.3mm case found both on amazon and ebay. It is very then and covers everything but the screen.

Unfortunately, it isn't a zoom: the focal length is not adjustable. Hey, what do you want for twelve bucks?You must be careful to disable the flash, as it is obscured by the lens and the reflections will ruin your pictures. This tele converter is surprisingly useful, and certainly something that the iPhone 4/4S-toting budding photographer should not be without. I just wish the case were a little better, or that the lens mount would evolve into some sort of a standard; it would be great to be able to have additional lens mounts fitted into every case.If you ever wanted to take close-ups with your iPhone, this inexpensive lens is just the ticket, and at this price, there's no reason not to splurge.

I was not expecting the finest quality leather, but I did think that it would be presentable. It is not. It is a pretty bright red color but the zipper is a different color. As a seamstress I am surprised that they did not use a neutral color rather than trying to mismatch the color. The workmanship is fine, packaging states that it is handmade. The credit card slots are small - however they are cheap material so will stretch easily. I think that I was most disappointed in the wriststrap - which is very difficult to fasten onto the wallet and does not look like it will hold very long.While I will use this item - I bought it because it has the zipped section, I am very disappointed in the quality.

I really wanted to like these headphones (see below).  However, after a week of regular use, they literally fell apart in my hand.  Their appears to be a manufacturing defect in how the two molded pieces of plactic are bound together at the earpiece (I took a picture to upload with this review but I cannot find an option to upload).  I would send them back for a refund, but I discarded the packaging.The reason I really wanted to like the headphones is that the sound was simply incredible, even compared against headphones in the $20.00 range.  Since I am not an audiophile, I cannot provide technical comment on the acoustics.Until the headphones fell apart, they performed extremely well.  They fit in the ear perfectly and were weighted in a manner that helped retain the position of the earpiece in the ear.  When used with the phone to make and receive calls, the sound was fantastic and I actually felt as if the person I was listening to was right next to me. Everyone I spoke to using these headphones reported that I sounded crystal clear.If you do decide to buy these headphones to try out, KEEP THE PACKAGING for 30 days in case they fall apart.  It is possible I was simply unlucky.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B003VYB9V6" id="B003VYB9V6-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-04-16:</strong> I bought a set of these earphones back in sept. of last year.

This item took 5 weeks from the date of order to be shipped to my house. Once it was here I tried to put it into the phone and it was found out to be defective being that it the lcd would not power on but the LED's did. I knew this because the LCD still worked on the old screen and I put the old one it to test it. So I called New Harbor to return the product and they wanted to try to trouble shoot the problem and they said it was my fault. Seeing as I am a professional I have never messed up a phone I knew it wasn't my fault. So they said I could send it back so I did, they made me pay for shipping and I had the tracking number. It was sent and was delivered and I still did not receive a refund. I finally had to call Amazon directly and they were very speedy about my claim. I received my refund from Amazon itself. Overall I will never buy from New Harbor EVER AGAIN.

This one is the one to have!  The fit was flawless; the quality was the highest I've seen.Two minor gripe, and they are common to all replacement iPhone screens:1) Apple's oleophobic coating beats, hands down, any replacement screen I've ever seen.  This one being no exception.  I can tell at almost a glance that an iPhone has had the screen replaced just by the way a replacement will attract fingerprints and face smudges.  &lt;sigh>2) No replacement glass I've ever purchased includes the wire-mesh ear speaker screen cover-dealing, nor the camera ring.  One must always pry these off the broken glass and transfer them to the replacement.  The vendor who includes these parts with the replacement screen should own the market!This one also came with a toolkit; to some folks that's important to know.  I've got so many toolkits from previous repairs that this didn't matter to me.My recommendation is that if you're in the market for a replacement screen for an iPhone 4 or 4S, seek out the one from KC Trade.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0068PRBGM" id="B0068PRBGM-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-06:</strong> Screen arrived in a couple of weeks after ordered.

The only drawback to this thing and it being the ultimate toy for your cat is its size our cat is semi-intimidated by it.  I think in time she'll grow to love it as much as I do. Now our cat Is about seven years old so her kitten years are well behind her. I think if you have kittens they would love the crap out of this toy.I went with this one over the 1.0 model because I wanted the longer battery life and the faster speeds. This thing is ridiculously fast almost to the point of being out of control when driving it with my iPad. I drive using the touchscreen instead of the tilt motion controls but both work amazingly well. Even though I have a constant fear of going to drive it down my basement stairs which I believe would destroy it. And there are many apps available on the App Store that you can use to make this a game but primarily for us at the cat toy and it's awesome at that.UPDATE: We taped a peice of string to this and it is so much more cat friendly :)  It stays on remarkably well.  The battery life is an hour plus, our cat get bored long before the battery wears out.I have said for years that a remote control ball would be the ultimate cat toy and I think that the Sphero almost fits the bill perfectly. If they can shrink the size in later versions this thing will be a no-brainer for every cat owner.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F35P69C" id="B00F35P69C-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-19:</strong> Before receiving my Sphero, I watched a very entertaining review on YouTube about it (by JuanBagnell) in which he pointed out that Sphero feels like it has a gerbil inside it.  And yeah, it really does.  An excited, manic little gerbil.  Once I got my Sphero, we quickly began to refer to it as "he" and "him," because it really does seem to be alive at times.  I particularly enjoy having Sphero to nuzzle up against my daughter, and it seems like he's doing it all on his own.  As weird as it sounds, we both have a lot of affection for this little guy.On the positive side of things, Sphero has a lot of speed and it's fun to pick what color you want him to be (despite my impression of him being male, my poor Sphero is usually pink or lavender).I know a lot of technology and research and development went into this thing, but I think the manufacturer, Orbotix, missed the boat on so many counts.First of all, Sphero can't do much.  He's kind of hard to control (aiming him onto the included little ramps is frustratingly difficult).  He's just this little ball that you can remotely cause to roll around.  You can use a "rainbow" function that makes him randomly change colors for a minute or so, but why not have that as a setting you can just turn on and leave on?  Or how about other customizable light settings?  It would have been cool to have been able to control him like LED Christmas lights with different effects.  It seems like that would have been so easy to do, yet they didn't.  Perhaps they are waiting for someone else to develop an app for it.Sphero also has a "spazz" function where he kind of hops around for a couple of seconds.  If he can have THAT much movement, why not program in other options?  I'd love for him to just roll around in a little pattern by himself so I could sit back and watch him.The spazz function often causes the aiming of Sphero to get out of kilter (as does driving him around erratically or running into things), so be prepared to often have to stop and re-aim him.I was really disappointed to realize that Sphero does not have sufficient traction and power to play with him on my lawn.  He just spins in place.  I could buy the separate "Nubby" cover, which will probably give him sufficient power to roll in the grass, but at this price point, considering that rolling is ALL Sphero can do, it just seems that a clear or white Nubby cover should have been included.  Unfortunately, not only was it not included, you can't even buy it separately!  At the moment, only orange is available (and that was "temporarily unavailable" until just recently), with blue and green coming sometime in the future.  But I don't see clear or white in the pipeline, and that's really what I'd prefer (to let Sphero's pretty colors shine through).The Orbotix software for Sphero is very buggy.  It crashes a lot, and I often have to "rename" my Sphero for no apparent reason.Speaking of renaming, the software does not currently have an option for renaming your Sphero.  I wrote to the company and asked about it, and the rep asked for my Sphero's MAC number (very hard to see in the software) and color code (when you start up Sphero, he flashes three different colors, which vary from one Sphero to another).  Then the rep told me that to rename Sphero, you should start up another Sphero app, then back out before using it, and when you go back into the Orbotix software, you can rename your Sphero.  This does work, but I really resent that the customer service guy made me jump through hoops rather than just telling me that.  And why isn't there just a settings control within the software to do this?And ever since I got Sphero, the Orbotix software kept promising that something was going to happen on 11/12/13 ("DEFEND," it cryptically says), but that date came and went without any change to Sphero (including the "DEFEND" screen, which still shows).  What the heck is that about?  (UPDATE:  With the next release of software, that screen no longer shows, but there is now an advertisement screen imploring you to "join the Robolution," which means applying to be a beta tester.  All that hype just for that??)All these points really bug me.However, Sphero is so endearing, I'm glad I have him.  I like to absentmindedly roll him around in the living room while I'm sitting with my husband as he's watching football.  It keeps me from getting too bored, and it's kind of relaxing.  I also like to roll him down the hall to knock on my daughter's door.  It's so cute when she says indulgently, "Sphero, is that you?"I'm really torn on how to rate Sphero.  The Orbotix software would get two stars.  Some of the third-party software is kind of clever, but none of the programs work that well or add much functionality, so the best of them would get maybe three stars.  However, Sphero himself works well, has excellent battery life, and seems very durable.  I'm hoping that future software will add more functionality.  But in the meantime, I can't help it, I really like my Sphero, even with his many flaws.  So I'm giving him four stars.UPDATE: After updating my software on 12-10-13, Sphero became mysteriously faster, which should be a good thing (especially in a wide-open area), but he also seems to have become much harder to control, even when set to a slow speed.  No other significant functionality was added with the update.  I'll have to get used to the new "feel" of Sphero, but right now, I'm thinking about dropping him down to three stars.  This last software update seems to have made him lose some of his "personality."</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F35P69C" id="B00F35P69C-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-25:</strong> i really like this gadget, thought it would be more premium feel.Android apps is a bit sluggishit requires a learning curve</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F35P69C" id="B00F35P69C-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-06:</strong> As an engineer, I can't help but be enamored by the technology and design of this wonderful little orb. Sphero is amazing to watch as it maneuvers on your command and the designers have put some features in (a tail, little tricks) that make the toy a bit more endearing, almost like a pet. There are some clever apps to let you drive Sphero around the house or over zombies. Or you can use Sphero as a controller to shoot down aliens and ingest energy pods. The color and movement are put to good effect.But I don't use it. My 16 year old son has lost interest. An my 8 year old boys lost interest after just a few tries. So I can't recommend it.First off, the control is very cool, but not good enough for the space we have. I think our home is about average in size with mostly hardwood floors. Perhaps we have a few patches of open space that are 5'x8' or 6'x6'. These spaces, however, are not large enough to control Sphero easily. Typically he (our is named Sphred) goes out of bounds and ends up under the couch or hitting the furniture. When he bounces, the calibration on direction gets off, so you have to readjust his tail to continue. Perhaps it is meant to be part of the challenge to account for the momentum, but it is a very frustrating learning process.When the virtual reality features kick in, it is doubly frustrating because Sphred is always leaving the screen. I go to shoot a zombie on the side and off it goes, I then have to align the tablet (I'm using an iPad), find him again, and then line up the next shot. I tried being closer and further and lowering the speed, but I've found it more frustrating than fun or challenging.The best use so far has been as a game controller. In one incarnation it controls yaw, forward, and lateral movements of a space ship. The spaceship is always firing, so gameplay is mostly moving and aiming. The other case is color grab, where your reflexes are tested to see if you can pick up the Sphero when it is a particular randomly chosen color. It is fun for a short while, but not captivating.I tried adjusting the power, and that helps control a bit, but it still remains very difficult. I tried him in a carpeted room and the carpet was too deep for him to start (although he could keep on going if he was already rolling.)I still plan to use it and play with it to see if there is more to it with the ramps and such; I just haven't gotten around to doing it and think part of that is the excitement has dwindled substantially.I feel bad about this review because it is a remarkable device and I have the highest respect for those who developed it. However I can't recommend it because just being cool isn't enough in this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F35P69C" id="B00F35P69C-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-09:</strong> Love this new model!!

If you like the idea of rolling a remote controled ball around at speeds of up to 6 ft/second (4 miles/hour), you will like this a lot.  Even better, if you are a programmer, it's basically a programmable robot!  If you don't think that sounds like fun, then don't buy Sphero, because that's pretty much what it does.- The biggest fan of this toy is my cat.  When he's bored, he'll bat it off of its charging stand and then look at me until I relent and play with him.  Not all cats will like it - it's not furry or anything, but just a smooth plastic ball about the size of a softball - but my cats love following it around, especially since it can go under dressers and other low surfaces.- I haven't tried out the programming environments, but according to the Sphero webpage, there are two ways to develop programs Sphero, which allows a lot of educational possibilities.  Check out the manufacturer page for more info - it seems like the programming environment is where this really changes from a cool toy into a robot.- If you're not into programming robots, then there are a variety of apps you can use.  The basic remote control app installs on an iOS or Android device, and allows you to control speed, change the light up color, and drive the ball around.  I have the app on my iPhone 4s and my 3rd gen iPad, and it works great.  (OTOH, it won't install on an older iTouch, to my daughter's disappointment.)  The controls aren't completely responsive, but we can get it flying around pretty well.  Other apps let you chase zombies or fight aliens.- Spero does well on solid surfaces, and OK on our plush carpet.  He's waterproof, and you can buy a studded plastic cover to allow him to get extra traction on grass or water (and to keep him clean during outside play).Like I said, if that sounds fun to you, then it will be, and if it doesn't, then it won't.  If you're buying it for someone else (human or pet), make sure you know them well enough to guess.

This adds a whole new level to family fun night. Going camping? Don't worry about it, you can take Sphero without worrying that it will get water logged and ruined. Pets? Easy, this is so much fun to play with them, too! Want to play a game on the tablet, or smartphone? You can use it as a 3D mouse! This has it all! What's even better is that your kids can do all of this and more with Dad!We are a very techy family. We love to try our hand at new things, and Sphero has allowed our 9 year old son to gain more insight and knowledge of what my husband does as an electrical repairman for a motor vehicle company. Not only that, but it has allowed our son to put down the game console controls, and pick up something that makes him use his brain! This was the biggest reason that we fell in love with Sphero.But, what does it come with and how much?Those are simply answered questions! Right now there is a special running--May 30 2014 through June 15, 2014--and you can grab Sphero 2.0 for Father's day at the awesome price of $99.99. It comes loaded with ramps, a quick start guide, charging base, and how to download the innovative apps for your iOS or Android systems.Won't it get scratched?Yes, like anything it needs to be protected from scratches and the like. Sphero has an awesome cover called a Nubby. With this, you get the protection needed and an added bonus of better traction. And you'll want the traction and protection with everything you'll be doing. The Nubby has been a life saver for our Sphero, since we take it everywhere! Gravel, concrete, grass, etc. You can choose from four colors, and the fun doesn't stop there!Reviewed By Steph for New Age Mama.

Compared to the prior version, this Sphero seems very quick and nimble.It seems very well built and sturdy, and the charging and Bluetooth pairing works flawlessly. The battery life seems quite good as you can use it for over an hour per charge.This can even be put into a swimming pool and there is an optional tire-like cover for it which makes it possible to move it in water and also protects the Sphero as well.The pairing to an iOS device like an iPhone or iPad works very well (also works with Android but I have no experience with that) and it is fairly easy to control on the touchscreen.But this is not just a remote controlled ball. There are a bunch of apps available that you can use to play augmented reality games with the Sphero. As an example, there is a game where you point your iOS device to the floor where the Sphero is and zombies appear on the screen as if they are on the floor, and you have to roll over them with the Sphero. This is a fun toy for kids who will likely get many hours or enjoyment out of it, especially when combined with some of the apps, of which there are more than 25 as of this review. Adults on the other hand may grow bored with it after a few weeks, however it can still be fun at parties since it lights up and you can change the internal LED color to any color you want.The price seems a bit expensive at first,  but considering all of the technology and R&D; involved such as an internal gyrospcope controlling the position of the ball, and Bluetooth controls, etc, it seems about right for what you get.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00F35P69C" id="B00F35P69C-review13" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-24:</strong> ...or at least I had never heard or it.  Here's how it goes:You get this product (Sphero) which looks and feels a bit like an oversize pool ball.  Then you download 1 or more of Orbotix's apps onto your iOS or Android phone.  Your phone then uses Bluetooth to send commands to the ball.  It has gyro positioning so even as it is spinning, it keeps track of which direction would correlate to each of up/down/left/right on your phone's virtual joystick and so you use that to control where the ball goes.  This does take some getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, you can fairly accurately drive it around the house.  It has mild impact resistance, so it will tolerate the inevitable crash into walls, the occasional fall off of a short (&lt; 18") surface, and a small amount of abuse from the toddler or cat you may have in your house that will certainly want to grab it.Besides just rolling it around, you can also change the color with a high level of precision (although my 5 year old was a little distressed that the red was not quite as saturated as she would have liked--it looked a little on the pink side).  But what is even cooler, is you can download other apps from Orbotix that let you play games ranging from augmented reality zombie wars to drawing something and having the Sphero then "draw" that picture (by rolling around and turning the colors you specify) on the floor.  Note that the augmented reality game is fun, but VERY hard until you really get the hang of operating this thing.My 5 year old thought it was fun, but got a bit frustrated with it after a while because it IS hard to control.  My mother-in-law thought it was a hoot and even my wife (who isn't normally in to this sort of thing) enjoyed a brief test drive.  Oh, and my 1 year old chased it around for the entire time anyone was playing with it and had a blast.This is a very fun toy.  A little on the pricey side, and it DOES require you to have a phone and download to it in order to work, but I think there are many groups of people who could get a real kick out it.  I'd say this would be best for ages 8-18, but our test included ages 1 to "grandma" and was well received by all.Recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00F35P69C', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00F35P69C', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B006LWLT24</h2>    <p class="price"> $B006LWLT24</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

Using the Bluetooth phone feature was a bit confusing at first especially when I forgot that it was set to Bluetooth and I tried to answer my phone without the headphones. Other than getting used to using Bluetooth, it is a great system. My only legitimate complaint would be the slight discomfort I feel after wearing them for several hours or when I wear them when laying down. The connecting piece rests behind my head and it can be uncomfortable when it presses against my ears or neck. This could be just my head size and the fit on my head and I really only notice it when I have been wearing them for several hours or in bed at night. I am sure they were not designed to be worn in bed for 10 hours at a time, or in the dentist&#8217;s office during surgery, but these are about the only times I have really had problems with the pain. Overall I love these headphones and the ease of using Bluetooth as a hands free phone.

I got these in November and the battery just died (17 Feb 2014).  I use these when riding my bike (to not have cables) and use them on average 3-5 times a week for 45-75 minutes at a time.  The battery lasted much longer than I expected!  I highly recommend these!!  After a full charge (took about 6 hours) I am ready to put these back in my gym bag!I got these to use while riding a bike (did not want the headphone cables hanging around when pedaling and getting caught on my knees or anything).  I was a tad hesitant since these were so cheap (money wise), but when I got this I was very surprised.  The quality was great, they felt well made and of high quality.  The item came with a cable for charging (I plugged it into the wall using a USB wall plug (one that came with a cell phone)).  After it fully charged (took about 2 hours).  I tried it out and it worked great.  To pair it I just held down the Phone button for like 7 seconds and than my iPhone saw it, I tapped it and it connected.  From that point on I all I had to do was turn the headset on (hold Phone button for like 3 seconds) and it would pair with the iPhone, and when I turned it off it unpaired.The headset is nice and folds over for small storage (I just toss it in a gym bag).  The over the ear part is sturdy and holds on nicely and the padding on the ear is soft and does not move on the ear.The device allows for me to skip songs (next/previous) and to play pause using the Phone button.  When I get a phone call I can answer it straight from the headphone by hitting the home button and the headphone has a built in microphone that allows for you to talk right with them on (I tested it out with a friend and they could hear me with no problem and I could hear them).  I can double press the Phone button and activate Siri on the iPhone and talk to her for doing anything (over the headphone).  The volume control on the headphone seems to adjust the volume on the headphone themselves and not on the iPhone, so if the iPhone is on full volume and you cannot hear it well, than you will need to turn it up on the headphones.  They are very loud and I do not need them on full (you can hear them playing when they are not even on when they are on full blast).In the end these are really nice and were a great buy!  They work perfectly and have a long time between charges (have not died on me yet, but will try to add to the review when I get an idea of how long they last, they do have an indicator to show when they are getting close, so you can charge them before they die and never have them go out on you.  I highly recommend these for a great value Bluetooth headset that phone and great audio support!  I have tested these out with an iPhone and they work great, as long as your device supports the Bluetooth profiles that this uses it should not have a problem.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-27:</strong> Keeping it simple.  They work.  Sound good.  Paired easily with my Galaxy 3s phone.  They do not annoy my ears by pressing to hard, nor do they bug me hooked around my ears.  I would not use them for running, as I sweat pretty heavily and I don't think they are sweat or water proof.  I do use them for walking and biking.  They work well for phone calls too, while riding or walking.  The sound quality for the phone is not great, but as I expect.  I had a set of similar Motorola headphones, and they did not last, so I bought these to save money, and if I had to I'd buy them again.  Hopefully they last a while.  Not running with them might help.  They are also not super light, but that said, I would not call them heavy.  Function buttons on the side are a plus.  Volume, next track, and stop button (phone pick up button).  They are arranged a bit odd, but you can get use to it.

I connected easily with my Droid Razr M and was pleasantly surprised at how good they sounded. I have used them for several trips on the train into Boston and still on the original charge. They cancel out the surrounding noise pretty well so you can hear your music at lower levels. They do go pretty loud but not as loud as my wired pair of headphones. Having the freedom to have no wires is well worth the small volume difference for me. It is so much easier to pull out my phone and not hav to have the hassles of the wire in the way.

I wanted  a little noise cancellation and I wanted to be able to listen to music. I connect these to my iPhone and it's great that I can turn the music up but still never miss a phone call. I've also paired them with my computer, but since there is some noise cancellation I am pretty sure I wouldn't hear my phone ring, plus if I go in the other room I will lose the computer connection while with the phone I can grab it and bring it with me. Overall I think I can be a decent distance away from the phone and still maintain a connection but it depends how many obstacles are involved and how long I'm away from it.The battery life on this seems pretty good, both active time and standby.I would not use these away from home. I have other headphones that work better for traveling/biking/commuting. These go around the back of your head and would not work well with a bike helmet and are also awkward with some hairstyles. Also not good for running or rowing. For tuning out that awful leafblower noise, they are very comfortable for at least a few hours. After about five hours I found they started giving me a headache, not sure if it was from the music or the very light pressure on my ears. The sound quality is very good, especially for something so reasonably priced.I do find the middle multi-function button to be sort of weird and struggle with turning it off sometimes. Several times I have accidentally returned a call to the last number to call me. Awkward.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review65" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-10:</strong> I got a &#34;warehouse deal&#34; on this thing, so perhaps my experience is not quite typical. Take all of this with a grain of salt.First of all, WOW! The freedom and mobility of bluetooth headphones for podcasts and music should NOT be underestimated. It's so nice to do laundry, load and unload the dishwasher, lift weights, exercise, and do all kinds of other things without being hampered by a cord. These are fantastic, in that regard -- that is, when they don't spontaneously lose the connection. That happens with startling regularity, though I have noticed that it happens much more often with my phone than with any other device. Thus, it seems possible (even likely) that the problem is more with my phone than with my headphones. The connection isn't even lost when I'm far from the phone -- the phone is in my pocket! So yes, I worry about that aspect.I've never used these things to have a telephone conversation. I assume they're probably capable of it, but I just don't like hands-free conversations. I therefore cannot speak to the headphones' performance in that regard. I can, however, vouch for their general utility as a media device. I'm kind of amazed at the battery life, too -- I will use these for the better part of a day. Off and on, connect and disconnect, over the course of 8-12 hours, and the battery doesn't quit. This is both good and bad -- good, obviously, for the convenience, but bad because I forget to charge them.In short, if you've never had bluetooth headphones and you are annoyed by your headphone wire sometimes, I recommend trying these out before you go and spend a mint on some super fancy pair.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review66" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-18:</strong> these are actually really good and have good sound (micro usb charging instead of mini usb) the earphones are nice and look good link bluetooth to the phone easily and easy to operate.

I will admit they feel like something made from recycled soda bottles,but  for the price they work and work well.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review70" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-23:</strong> Works great - love it!

Also can act as a microphone for conversations, but the mic in the device could be stronger. Keep in mind that the mic is pretty far away from your mouth, however. Wearing these for a period of time can cause discomfort in your neck because the hook part that connects the ear pieces rubs against the back of your neck in an uncomfortable way. Item also feels cheap as it is 90% plastic casing. I'm extremely careful with these as it feels like they will fall apart at any time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review76" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-15:</strong> Bought this fir my wife's birthday.

I bought them as a first pair of bluetooth headphones primarily to listen to podcast (not hi-fidelity) audio without having a cord.I've paired the headphones with two different phones and also a computer.  All three times the pairing worked fine.  To date I've probably listened to 5-hours of DVD audio (binge watching TV shows on a laptop), and about 10-hours of podcasts.  The audio at all times has been perfectly acceptable with no notes of any problem at all and volume loud enough for my needs.  The fast forward/reverse, and volume up/down buttons work fine, as does the multi-touch button.  So the controls are fine.As for the internal microphone used for making calls, although this isn't why I bought the headphones, I have used the headphones to make a couple of calls, once from a busy street.  Both times the person I was speaking with made no comment about call quality and I experienced none either.  So call quality was fine.So, why only three stars?  Well, I give nothing 5 stars unless it's the absolute best thing ever.  So why not four stars?  Well, the fit is a bit annoying.  When wearing the headphones as designed the skin behind my ears can be rubbed a *little* raw, and if I'm wearing a jacket, the bracket of the headphones that goes around the back of the head gets bumped by the jacket occasionally and moves the headphones in an annoying fashion.If I could I'd give 3.5-stars because the price of about $21 was definitely right, and the fact that the headphones fold is nice.  Still, after using these headphones for a bit I'm more firmly convinced that what I really want are some type of bluetooth earbuds.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review92" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-14:</strong> These headphones are light weight and feel comfortable for hours at a time.

I've always been cautious of spending too much on Bluetooth headphones, as there's a level of diminishing returns--that is to say, there's only so much fidelity you can expect from Bluetooth.The SB240 provides solid sound at a reasonable price.  I've tried them out on music from Simon & Garfunkel to Type O Negative, and it handles everything I throw at it at volume levels above what I'm comfortable listening at.  It may not provide enough bass for a metal freak or a rap fan, but it sounds competent.  Spoken word is clear and audible, and phone calls come through quite clear.While I'm not a fan of the multifunction button concept, the layout is otherwise quite good.  There is a &#34;pinwheel&#34; design to the four outer buttons (volume +/-, forward, back) that makes them easier to find than flat buttons.  All the buttons provided sufficient resistance to avoid accidental presses but not so much as to make it hard to work your device with a quick press.  I can't get the multifunction button to trigger voice dialing, but this may be a problem with the Galaxy S4 I use with it.  It will redial, play/pause and answer calls with no issue.  Lack of voice command activation from my headset is not a big deal breaker for me, but it is something to consider.My biggest complaint is that the headset is a little tight.  This is unlikely to be an issue for other consumers, as my head is incredibly large.  The behind-the-head style of headphones tends to eventually conform to the user's head.  These headphones will fit a wide range of people.I'm not exactly sure how long the battery lasts, but in attempting to fully discharge it I left music playing through them overnight and still had juice to go in the morning.  This was after a few hours of use already, putting the life at least upwards of ten hours (and probably more).The bottom line is it's hard to imagine getting better sound in this price point.  If you can deal with a few minor niggles, this is a solid buy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review113" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-20:</strong> It works, but the range on this thing sucks, hence the rating.

I was using the newer earbuds from apple and found them quite uncomfortable as they slipped out of my ear canal and were very poor in cutting out the noise of traffic when walking near a road. I decided to get these headphones after reading the other reviews. At the price, they are just perfect. I just took my first walk and didn't even charge them and they still had enough juice to finish my 45 minute walk. The earphones are now plugged into my USB Mac power outlet to charge them up fully. The instructions are a little weak, but not too bad. I like how easy it is to increase volume and set the other settings with a simple touch on the right hand earpiece. The bluetooth paring was a snap. I have had other behind the ear headsets and this one is the most comfortable I have ever use. A good purchase and quality product for the money.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00AVLOHJ8" id="B00AVLOHJ8-review116" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-25:</strong> Originally purchased this for my daughters Nabi Tab 2 and it works great, but the wife was jealous of a 2 year old having them, so I synced them to her Samsung Prevail.

You can submerge it in water, take it into the desert, and knock it around quite a bit, and it will protect your phone well. Putting my iPhone into this case was almost like sealing into a vault. Nothing gets in or out, not even dust - it even comes with a special waterproof headphone jack. It fits together so well, in fact, that you need a flat-head screwdriver (or the edge of a coin, as the manual suggests) to pry the phone out.The screen protector itself is pretty nice too.  As opposed to other "strong" screen protectors, it doesn't feel oddly thick or create glare. And even though this case pretty much entombs the phone, both the speakers and buttons all work quite well. The only thing I really had trouble with was the lock/unlock switch.As for the feel of the case, well, it definitely adds bulk. It's not something I'd really want to be carrying around unless I really was worried about serious damage occurring. So the bottom line is this: If you're looking to take your iPhone in an extreme environment (i.e. one that involves heavy rain, sands storms, etc.), then this Lifeproof iPhone case will do a pretty good job. For normal, everyday use, it's probably overkill.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-28:</strong> I have a couple of criteria for a case.  One, I want it to be easy to get in and out and I want it to be secure.  Lifeproof is the easiest tough case I have tried.  It snaps on easily and it came off easily.  Once one, it is easy to access the ports and headphone jack so you do not need to remove it regularly.  (My main reason to remove it because I have a battery case that I use frequently when I travel.)I have not tried submerging in water (frankly it scares me to try).  But I did have my niece give one of my earlier phones a bath in my dog's water bowl.  So it is a feature that I really like.  Even if it is just water resistant, that should be enough.The case was responsive to touch on the screen.  I actually think it is better than just the plain screen protector that I had on previously.My two complaints are that the mute button is pretty stiff and that the sound is pretty weak.  But the speakers are behind a waterproof membrane.  It is not that the sound is distorted, it is just that it is a bit quieter than when the case is off.  That is a fairly small price to pay for water proof.  But if you regularly listen to your iphone via the speakers in loud environments, you might be aware of that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-07-06:</strong> This case is extremely thin because it's so thin the cases actually really fragile and it broke when I dropped it from about waist height but I still like that it was so thin and the mat feel on the case</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> I followed all instructions to the letter on this case. When it arrived I opened it carefully and I put it in water as instructed. It passed all the tests so I got ready to place it on the phone. I did note that it seems rather flimsy for such an expensive case. I also am not fond of the back piece as it feels really like cheap plastic and it is not pleasing in my hands at all. My Iphone fit the case well overall and I didn't have any issues getting it placed in and the case snapped around it.My main issue is the screen. It doesn't fit flush because of that little black piece on the top of the front of the case inside which seems to be what is creating the slight bump out for the screen. I looked through all the directions but did not see that this was to be removed or shifted so I left it. It's sort of like when a box doesn't close - and there is just that one spot that is so annoying because it sits just above the rest. I am kind of picky and this drives me crazy *because* it means my screen has that rainbow effect after the case has been on one day. I use screen protectors frequently and I cannot stand to have any sort of distortion through the screen. This case causes massive distortion to me once it has been on about a day or more.The things that worked for me are the sound and the buttons. All worked well and I had no problems using buttons nor accessing the screen through the protector. The headphone piece, as I usually use bluetooth, wasn't a deal breaker. What was the breaker was what happened to the screen and the image distortion with the part that I can see from various angles. It is all causes by that one small piece of plastic that sticks out.Overall, while I feel if I am going into a very water logged environment I might use this, as an everyday case it just doesn't cut it for the price due to the screen issue.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review6" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-13:</strong> This is a difficult review because, if you want water proof, shock proof and all around protection for your phone, your are not going to get it without some draw backs. It's just not possible to avoid putting on a heavy oxygen tank for deep see diving.What I did like was that this case has a much slimmer profile than some of the competitor shock proof products. That made it easier to handle as well as a better look.I did some testing and my phone was protected in drops. However, one annoying thing I noticed is that, when I would place calls a buzzing sound was emit in intervals. I assume that the case kinda blocked the signal a bit.The other thing that I didn't like was the sound is kinda muffled. That said, there is just no way to protect your phone in an encasement and not have the sound compromised.Using ear plugs would avoid that, however, once again to water proof the phone they have to include a special audio plug which kinda felt like a nuisance to keep up with.At the end of the day, it really comes down to understanding that in order to protect your phone fully, you will have to deal with some drawbacks.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review7" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-01:</strong> I don't completely trust this case but if I'm going to the beach or pool I put this case on it I don't like dunk it under water but I use my phone if its wet or it water splashes on it my phone is okay</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review8" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-21:</strong> It took me a few weeks to install this case, because the manufacturer suggests you test the seals on the case before you install.  That's probably a good idea, but it takes at least an hour.  Once installed, it works well.  There is some sound stifling, but I expect that in a waterproof case.  The camera quality is degraded a bit (also expected), but not really that noticeable.  The screen and sound are better than my Otterbox, and it's much thinner.I'm not sure of the shockproof value of the phone, but I did drop it in water by accident and it still works, so it really is waterproof.  That being said, I dropped my iPhone 3 in an Otterbox in water and the phone suffered damage.  I think the Otterboxes are probably more "shock proof," but definitely not more waterproof.  I really don't see how a case this thin could survive much shock, but iPhones themselves are pretty resilient to being dropped.Overall, I like this case a lot and think it already saved my phone.  I've had two Otterboxes in the past, and this case is superior.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review9" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-18:</strong> This is not as lifeproof as you think it will be.The water seal compartment of this case is great IF the case doesn't get dropped.That's correct..... if the case doesn't get dropped.

I love taking it to the coast or to swimming pools. It is natural that I'll love it on my iPhone 5 as well. But here's the thing: my iPhone 5 is $650 to replace and my Flip is $150. The fix? Lifeproof guarantees it will be waterproof. I found that it was for those shallow dips under water for videos and pics of the kids jumping in or trying to swim. I did not (and don't recommend) the 6 foot deep limits I've read you could do.This is a very thin case for a fully wrapped case. Unlike Otterbox, this one adds very little thickness. It still feels like a smaller phone.I found the screen to be responsive and the buttons are all in the right place. It did not affect my use of the phone.CONS:As for protection this isn't the best case. If you want shock and drop protection I'd recommend an Otterbox or even an Incipio.I've seen one of these get dropped a couple times and the clips not hold it together well. (I wonder if the warranty on the waterproof would still work if the case was slightly damaged. I think not.) It doesn't hold up as well and it won't protect your phone as well.There is no warranty for if your device breaks from a drop or fall. This is normal, but it isn't really "life proof" is it?Overall a nice waterproof case that isn't as strong or safe as some others like the Otterbox. It is thinner though and much better than snap on cases.

He had already broken one iPhone because it got wet inside while he was running - the price tag for the case is high, but it's nothing compared to buying a new phone.Before you insert your iPhone into the case, you can first test to make sure that it's actually waterproof. This is very easy to do and it helped to make me feel comfortable once I'd put the iPhone in - I knew that water couldn't get in.In addition, the case is very light which I like because it doesn't add any weight to the phone. The case is also surprisingly attractive for the purpose; it means you won't look silly carrying it out and about. It's also very easy to use the iPhone while it's housed in the case. Some cases make the buttons hard to press.  This one doesn't.LifeProof iPhone 5 case also comes with a headphone adapter that allows you to use headphones in wet environments - so you can still listen to music while you need your iPhone to stay safe and dry.I would recommend this case. It has really solved a problem for us and means that my husband's phone can once again fulfill its purpose without getting damaged. I love that this case allows you to live your life, use your phone, and leave your worries for other aspects of life.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review14" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-17:</strong> My husband working in construction so when he got iPhone 5 we decided to look for case that really protect the phone from not only dropping and hitting it on hard surfaces but from dirt and moist. When I found this case I was shocked by price but we got it just to try. It has been maybe more than couple of month now and his phone is in perfect condition! If this iPhone 5 in this case survived construction surrounding and my husband's lack of gracefulness when handling the phone it is GREAT case. Not only that, I really like how it feels in hands when you use the phone. Doesn't add bulkiness at all.Touch screen respond as if there is nothing on the screen.Great case, thinking to get myself one of those.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review15" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-01:</strong> I like this case.  It provides complete protection against water, dust, and dirt yet is less than 1/4" longer, about as wide, and a little bit thinner than may "regular" case, anIncipio Dual PRO iPhone 5 case.It's actually pretty remarkable, using lightweight and thin-yet-strong materials to provide complete coverage for my phone.  The case even looks "normal" at first, or second for that matter, glance.  All the buttons are covered and still easy to operate, the charge/sync port has a hinged cover, and the headphone jack has a screw-on cover.This is perfect for my Beach Vacation case (or skiing case, camping case, etc) because it gives my phone a fighting chance if it encounters The Elements.  Frankly, even though it is waterproof I would never intentionally take it swimming (for example).  However, on more than one occasion I've been about to jump into a pool when I realized my phone was in my pocket.  Now, I'll still pause to set it safely aside and probably not have to replace it if I don't.The integrated screen protector is nicely responsive and does introduce a small amount of distortion; you might notice it if you're looking for it.  Something I was impressed with was the sound... my phone seems louder while it's in the case and I didn't notice any of the distortion that was mentioned in other reviews.It was pretty easy to get my phone into (and out of) the case.  I wouldn't want to do it every day and I don't think the case was designed for that.  However, doing it periodically wouldn't pose a problem for me or the case.  Once you have it open the main gasket, the narrow band of silicon (or silicon-like) material that helps seal water out and iPhone goodness can be removed.  The reason you want to do that is to make sure it's clean and, if you want to get fancy, maybe rub on a very thin layer ofSilicone Grease.I would use this as my regular case without any reservations except I have two reservations.  Firstly, the charger/sync port, complete with its hinged cover, is incompatible with my proclipusa car mount. Secondly, the headphone jack, with the cover removed, doesn't work with most headphones because their plugs won't fit.  The case comes with a screw-in extension that maintains the watertight seal and allows you to plug in headphones at the other end.  While I'm at home, I don't want to have to deal with the extra piece and while I travel, I don't mind the extension on the plane and use Bluetooth headsets elsewhere.  As I said, for me it's perfect for travel and maybe OK for most people all the time.  Also, neither of these needs to be a showstopper.  The hinged cover is held in place with a pin similar to the ones used to attach watchbands and it takes about a minute to remove or replace it using a small screwdriver or pocketknife.  Some headphones will work just fine if they have long, straight, narrow plugs.I guess it's a bit on the pricey side and it fills the need to provide coverage against "contaminants" while appearing to be a regular iPhone case as opposed to a plastic bag or, as a friend described some of the alternatives, an early 1990s style mobile phone.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review16" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> I like the case and it works for what it is supposed to but the price on it is just excessive.It was fairly easy to get the case lined up and put all the seals in the right place and everything else.The pre-test to actually putting the case on the phone went excellent and so did the testing after the case was on the phone.I haven't had any issues with it at all at this time I just think that the price tag they have on it is just excessive.Some of the things that I do like about the case.Button feel through the case is pretty decent, you can actually feel that you have pressed the button, other cases don't offer that.The audio plug adapter works like it should and I like that it screws in the case. This helps because in the past I have actually damaged the phones audio socket because I accidentally bent the plug that goes into the phone. This type of socket setup gives a more secure location there and works well for those that like to work out with their phones playing music in their ears as it's less likely to damage that plug through accidental abuse while you are working out.Overall it's a nice case and works at the job it's supposed to but I would like to see a better price on it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review17" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-24:</strong> My Lifeproof case has protected my phone from multiple drops on hard concrete and hardwood floors.  I wash it off under a faucet but have never dipped it in water.  It is a little bulky and some aftermarket connections may not reach the charging and headphone ports because they are deep inside the case.  However, some do and that seems a small price to pay for the excellent protection.  I do notice a little touch senitivity loss on the plastic screen but you get used to it quickly.  I like the product and it is high-quality and extremely protective of your phone.  Just drop you iPhone in water once and you will regret not having a waterproof case.Recommended.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review18" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-06:</strong> I got this case through Vine, so I didn't have to suffer the price of it, but I do believe the price I see for it to be out of line.  It is a nice enough case.  It looks fine.  It is designed to be waterproof and it passed the water test I put it through.  So, it should be a good case to use for outdoor or any activities where your phone might otherwise get wet - I like to kayak, so it should do well with my phone in my pocket in this case.  I also very much like the fact that you can attach a lanyard/strap to the case.  That feature has been a phone saver for me many times and it's not that common.But, why should this case cost over $70?  Based on its look, feel, construction, etc., I would've guessed a price of certainly under $50 and maybe under $40.  I think one of its big competitors, Otterbox, offers a lower cost option that looks more substantial to me.  I guess if you like this case's look and features and don't mind the price, it should be OK.  It just doesn't look like good value to me.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review19" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-06:</strong> In the past I'd always thought Lifeproof cases actually guaranteed your phone wouldn't break once inside it.  On this model, there's plenty of warnings and disclaimers specifically stating they offer no guarantees.This case is much sleeker than an Otterbox defender, and is waterproof, so those could be two reasons to pick this over the otterbox.  My wife hated the styling and the fact that the volume and mute controls stick out from the side of the case (along with two extra protrusions).  She said the styling looked like a "man's case".  To be fair, the case is mostly grey on the edges and the back is white.  The screen shield is actually white around the edges to mimic the iphone - it's not clear all the way around.  Therefore, putting a black iPhone into this case will make it look like a white iphone from the front, although the apple logo on the back will still show the actual black iphone.I'd be a bit worried to actively use this case underwater, and I don't think that's what it's intended for.  The charging port hatch could be knocked open and then water would easily get in.  I think this case is intended to protect against accidents, not to allow you to use your phone underwater.I had no problems with the sound, either on speakerphone or using normally.  I know other have complained about this, but in my experience, the phone sounded very natural as if nothing was different about it.The main issue is using the touchscreen.  Since the earpiece has a small piece of plastic between the phone and the screen shield, it does create a gap.  Even other parts of the shield don't "stick" or lay perfectly flat against the phone's screen.  Therefore, you have to press harder to get the touch to register.  It's not significant, but you are pressing the screen shield against the screen to eliminate any gap, and then it registers.  In some spots there's no problem, but in others it can be annoying.So those are the main tradeoffs, which I think are acceptable for special occasions such as sports or trips to the beach, but it's not something I'd want to have on my phone all the time.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review20" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-08:</strong> This makes a great case, and doesn't add a lot of bulk.

The negative about this case is that it is sort of like wrapping your phone in a condom.  The front screen is relatively thin plastic that sits over the screen.  The rest of the case is more on the flimsy side.  I guess it might work.For me, the biggest deal killer is that the headset jack is covered because the phone is waterproof.  So you have to unscrew the cap to get to the headset jack.  If you want to ensure that your phone is waterproof, you've got to then use the included headset screw to attach to the headset jack.  Basically, it's a huge pain in the butt in my opinion.  I can't see that really being useful for very long.I think you'd have to figure out how much life-proofing your life needs for this case.  I think there are other cases that protect almost as much that aren't waterproof that don't mess up the screen display.  Otterbox cases seem to always be consistent and feel better made.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review24" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-02:</strong> Excellent case, easy to install and use.

He told a friend who purchased one from a different website (not the manufacturer). The friend wanted it because he is on a boat everyday and his phone is at risk of being splashed or rained upon. Next, my husband purchased one from that same other website, mostly since he liked the idea that the phone would not get ruined in the heavy rain we get here or God forbid it falls into a toilet by accident (it's happened before).Next, I was offered a Lifeproof case from the Amazon.com Vine program, and I accepted delivery of that.  Then, in telling this tale chronologically,  the friend's case leaked and when he phoned Lifeproof to ask for a replacement, they said his case was counterfeit and that the only authorized dealers to sell it are Lifeproof.com and Verizon, that all others are counterfeit. We then called Lifeproof and discovered that indeed the one WE bought from the other website was ALSO counterfeit, the rep insisted that the only two legitimate dealers selling authentic cases was Verizon and Lifeproof (what about Amazon - since I received one from Amazon.com's Vine program?). I then contacted Amazon.com Vine program staff and was told ours is genuine. I do not understand why Lifeproof customer service staff do not know that Amazon.com is an authorized Lifeproof case dealer!After the use in our family, my husband and son still liked the case, so decided that the authentic (not fake) Lifeproof case is worthwhile and we purchased one from Amazon.com about a week ago. Beforehand, we had researched their Total Water Protection Program which is an insurance policy that appeared to be sold via Lifeproof.com. We assumed that we could purchase said program after buying one from Amazon.com (because nothing on the site explains otherwise). When we attempted to register the case so we could get the protection, the rep (on 6/26/13) again said that there are no dealers other than Verizon and Lifeproof.com that sell authentic Lifeproof cases. I told her that I had an email from Vine staff saying it was legitimate. She asked me to forward her the email from Amazon.com Vine staff that says that Amazon.com sells authentic cases (but I had already deleted it thinking I'd never need that proof). She said that she suspected this case from Amazon.com is a fake case, she asked the price, and said she thought that I bought it from a third party seller. I pulled up the receipt from Amazon while speaking to her. She did not believe that the case was bought "from Amazon and shipped by Amazon" - a term she used that is the truth of what our order stated. I also discussed the Vine program that Lifeproof provided the product to Amazon.com who gave one to me to product test but she did not believe me, saying only Verizon and Lifeproof.com sell the official cases!After me freaking out a bit and after being on hold, she then said that the cases sold by Amazon.com *may be* authentic but that any case bought there cannot ever have the TWP Program added onto the case. This is not clear as of 6/26/13 on either the Lifeproof website who sells it, nor on the Amazon.com page. She also asked that I contact Amazon.com customer service to get them to get proof that they really sell non-counterfeit Lifeproof cases and to forward her that reply in writing! Are you serious? I, the customer, have to get proof that YOUR COMPANY is selling through Amazon.com?I further learned, just to be clear, that the TWP Program covers replacement of the case if the case leaks, but any damage to your iPhone is your problem. Although the Lifeproof website says today that the buyer can have "complete confidence, complete freedom" and encourages us to submerge it underwater while we "swim, surf, or soak" as well as get it dirty with dirt, be in the snow, ice or sleet, that we can ice skate, ski, or walk in snow or slush. It also says it is shockproof and can be dropped without fear of damage.There is a murky line between what the case protects against without the TWP Program and if you wanted to buy the TWP Program just to be on the safe side, know that as of 6/26/13 the only companies you can purchase from to qualify for that purchase are Verizon and Lifeproof.com - and it must be purchased on the day you buy the case. And that they will only replace the case not the damaged or broken iPhone.Also be forewarned that counterfeits are out there and be careful who you buy from. We chose to buy from Amazon.com because it was discounted, it was covered on Amazon Prime for fast shipping and delivery and because shipping with Prime is free. I had not dreamed that Lifeproof would later deny that Amazon.com is not an authorized dealer or that we would not be eligible for their full protection guarantee program if we chose to buy from Amazon.com. According to the Lifeproof customer service rep, this decision was made "by the Big Man Upstairs". I asked that my complaint be forwarded to management and she said something to the effect that there were no plans to change the program for customers who choose to purchase from anyone but Lifeproof.com or Verizon.--Regarding the use of the case:The screen protector thing takes away some sensitivity and it can take two or three tries to get the action you swipe or touch to occur. I do not like that. My husband and son live with it and accept it as a tradeoff for the benefits of the case.In order to use the aux jack to listen to music with a headset or over your car stereo system you have to use an adapter thing that screws in. This can get lost. The first one we had broke. We phoned Lifeproof and they sent a replacement quickly at no charge. Your other alternative if you do not have the jack with you is to remove the case from the phone and use the port directly.This review was updated by being re-written and downscaling the rating to 1 star = I Hate It on 6/26/13.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>1</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review26" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-01:</strong> Lifeproof cases have garnered much attention and namesake throughout the past few years. With a great name, a beautiful set of packaging, and an attractive promise that it is totally waterproof, Lifeproof has become almost a household name, next to Otter Box.SIZE and FORM FACTORThe case will make your iPhone seem slightly more bulky than a lot of cases, but it's what you pay for. There isn't a way to make your phone well protected without adding considerable bulk. The good news is that, instead of the Otter Box, the edges are made out of a hard plastic, so it doesn't get sticky or cause friction going in and out of your pants pocket. Around the volume slider you find two raised notches that indicate to you, I guess in the dark, where the volume buttons can be found. Also, to keep the device waterproof, there is a screw in piece covering the headphone jack.SCREEN PROTECTORWhile somewhat thin for a cover for the screen, it seems somewhat mundane, causing some texting issues. Not skin tight on the monitor unfortunately.SHOCK PROTECTIONBecause it's not made of a thick rubber, and more of a hard plastic, I'm not sure how well this unit will hold up against smashing. I can see my screen still getting cracked....but hey, at least it's waterproof.WATER PROOFThe thing to do, because you never want to trust something like this completely, is to test the Water Proof claim of each case before putting your $700 iPhone inside. I did that by tearing a piece of paper towel up, and placing it inside of the case. I closed the case up, and then submerged it into a pot of water for 10 minutes or so. I took it out, dried off the case, opened the case, and inspected the towel. I did this before putting my iPhone in it at all. Remember that when they manufacture millions of these, some are bound to be a bit defective.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review27" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-30:</strong> So I bought this for my husband and honestly did work and I was happy but after 5 months later and accidentally dropped my phone started tearing some parts and now is where sand gets inside and water so not too happy for paying $79.99 + S&H of 3.99 = $83.98.

It's cool that it's waterproof and all, but after running the initial &#34;test&#34; then putting the phone in I was less than impressed by how the phone handled while inside the case. The keyboard area of the phone had a pocket of air/&#34;space&#34; between the iPhone's screen and the case. This caused a large headache when trying to type. I would have gotten used to pressing more firmly to get the screen to recognize my hand.For special occasions like the water park? Lake? Boating? Hiking? Outdoors activities? Maybe during the winter? Sure. I'll definitely pull it out, retest the case to ensure it's still water proof, then pop my phone in and keep things nice and safe. But not very practical for every day usage in my situation.I opted instead for a basic Belkin TPU case (similar to what I had for my previous iPhone 4).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-06:</strong> The LifeProof fre Series Case for my iPhone 5 is working well.

I put it on, and realized I hated it because it was so bulky.  I never used it.  Now that I have an iPhone 5, I was willing to try the next great thing I've been hearing about for waterproof cases.  In the summer I spend a lot of time outside at my pool with my kids, so having a waterproof (and Lifeproof) case is probably a good idea.  A guy I know had a Lifeproof case, and he showed it to me.  He's an Army guy, someone who does tough mudder races and the like, so I tucked the info on the Lifeproof case away in my head until later.  If he likes it, it must be good.  Summer was approaching, so I thought about waterproof cases again.  So I got this.  Love it!The instructions inside the box are good, so follow them.  This case is water tested before being approved to ship out.  However they do want you to do your own water test before putting your iPhone in it.  It is just to be on the safe side.  It's easy enough to put together, because anything that is waterproof has a gasket, or what they call an "O-ring".  Just do the underwater test, which takes an hour, then you should be set to put the case on your phone.  Use the timer on the iPhone so you don't forget about it.Put the case on the phone, making sure that all of the edges are neatly closed up, and the headphone jack cover is secured.  This case comes with a headphone adapter, which is a little cord that plugs into the case, to your Iphone, and connects the headphones.  The best thing about this is that you can store your little headphone jack cover in it, it has a screw in spot for it to rest in, so you don't lose it.One of the best things about this case is that it's not bulky.  It is not meant for people who want to drop their phone from three stories up onto the cement, it's to protect from dropping while standing on the ground.  If you want something toddler-proof, you should look at other choices.  The only thing that would make this better for me is if it came with a waistband clip, which is something I really use a lot with my everyday phone case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review31" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-24:</strong> very cheap quality for the price and isn't even water proof.

It replaced an Otterbox Defender that I was very happy with... Except for the dust that would collect in it.  Frankly, if I was planning to throw my phone out a second-story window, I'd choose the Otterbox (there's a YouTube video of a guy who does that with an iPad:)  Yes, the sound from the speaker is noticeably different, and the sound of callers' voices are a *little* different, but I've used it 2 weeks now and no one that I've called has said that I sound any different.  The screen cover floats over the glass and took about 10 minutes to get used to.  It also shows fingerprints a lot more than the glass, but cleans up easier.  I'm pretty sure I'm not going to use it underwater, but it's nice to know that I have the protection.The main reason it's replacing my Otterbox is that I keep my phone in my front pants pocket and the material and size is much easier to get out when it rings.  And no dust.  I love the no dust under the screen.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review34" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-30:</strong> I originally gave this case five stars because I loved almost everything about it, but then it developed an annoying, intermittent hum during some but not all phone conversations.  The hum doesn't correspond to the voices, either mine or the person on the other end, but instead seems random, sometimes in long notes, others in short pulses.  As a waterproof case, this case still deserves 5 stars, but as an everyday case, only 3 stars.  My original review follows:---As someone who spends a lot of time outdoors, I have a real need to protect my iPhone.  I have tried other products designed to waterproof my iPhone 5, and they have had been nothing more than glorified vinyl bags.  This Lifeproof fre is the only one that looks and acts like a regular case while giving the phone extra protection.  For that, I love it.  The Lifeproof case is relatively easy to get on and off, and it keeps the phone slender and lightweight.  You wouldn't guess the amount of protection it gives just by looking at it.The case comes in two parts, top and bottom, and it comes with an headphone jack adapter to use earbuds/headphones while still keeping the case watertight.  The adapter has an extra headphone jack cover in the holder.  You must test the case, following the instructions, to make sure it is watertight before putting your phone inside.  The test also serves as a trial run for how to use the case since there are several ways you can go wrong.  First, the seal must be perfect all the way around; you have to press all the way around to get both pieces flush so the interior O-ring can work.  Also, the headphone jack needs to be screwed in, and the tab covering the lightning port snapped shut.  Any mistakes in the preceding will result in a non-waterproof case.  Once you realize what must be done, you can tell at a glance whether the case is properly installed.The white case makes my black iPhone look like a white one because of the way the top screen mimics the actual look of the phone.  Inside the case, the phone looks like it's inside an ordinary, low-profile case.  The thin top screen is almost as sensitive as the iPhone itself; I have no problem swiping, texting, and selecting apps.  I've asked people halfway through phone conversations if they notice any sound problems, and they have been surprised that I asked.  I can hear calls, ringtones, and music perfectly.  If there's muting, it's subtle.  The only weird part is that the sound vibrates the back of the case, and that was disconcerting at first.  Although the user must remove the headphone jack screw to use earbuds, I don't find that a problem since I rarely use the headphone jack.  If you want a waterproof case, you're going to have to deal with some variation of this issue since there's no way to connect headphones directly into the phone while maintaining the integrity of a watertight seal.There are only two minor aspects that I don't like about the case.  One, the Lifeproof screen does not sit flush with the phone at the top because of a interior disk, and that results in slight rainbow touch marks on the screen.  The other problem is the exterior access to the mute button.  Unlike the button on the phone, the Lifeproof mute button is not a switch.  You push it up and down the way you would operate the real one, but there's no visible way to tell whether your phone is already on mute.  I find myself switching it on and off and looking at the screen to see whether my phone is silenced or not.---Customer support is non-existent.  I submitted a tech support ticket, received confirmation of its receipt, and then heard nothing.  It has been over a week since I tried to contact LifeProof.I was thrilled with this case because it's better than anything else I've come across.  I love that I can slip my phone in my pocket and not worry about being caught in the rain.  I can take it with me to the beach or in a boat or hiking or to a theme park with water rides -- and I don't have to worry about destroying my phone in the process.  If you often use the headphone jack on your phone, I'd recommend getting this case only as a specific-occasion use and having another for every day.  I just cannot stand the hum in my ear.  I plan to use this only in outdoor circumstances when I might expect the phone to get wet and not for every day as I was previously using it.-- Debbie Lee Wesselmann</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review35" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-18:</strong> This case feels a little plastic but probably does the job for someone who has their iPhone working in areas that need more protection, wet hands, wet areas, sand, dirt, etc. The protective area film is well fit and does not impair sensitivity of touch. I would recommend it for anyone who really has to have a waterproof case. However, I was not willing to try the waterproof feature...You need to carefully fit the iPhone in the case and snap down the cover well as designed to ensure that the waterproof works. It has a screw in headphone plug which is tight and there was an extra plug included in my case as well as an extension cord for the headphone slot. It's hard to remember to have the extension for the headphone unless you leave it on the headphones you use (plug it into the headphones) but that has a small plastic piece that has a screw plug for the headphone so you don't have to remember to bring that along when you need to plug the phone to make it waterproof.I had the Griffin Survivor for my iPhone 4s and it was easier to put on but much more bulky and not waterproof (but water resistant). The LifeProof case is slim and makes the iPhone a little wider and longer, not much. The Survivor came with a holster clip which was handy as it is unlikely with the bulk, that you were going to put this phone in a pocket.For a comparative case, try the Incipio Atlas. It just came out and is rated by reviewers on the Web as better. A little pricer, $100, but it has a guarantee for one year (non-transferable) that you can fill out via an app. The Atlas gives LifeProof a serious run for its money and Incipio makes other types of well-made and thin but protective cases too for those times you do not need this type of protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review36" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-09:</strong> If my only concern was that my phone would suffer water damage, and if the only time I ever used my phone was with a bluetooth headset, I'd think this was the best phone cover ever.  The case is extremely thin and lightweight... plus it's entirely water proof (up to 6.5 feet)  and it really works!  I tested it, and there's complete protection from moisture getting inside.  Amazing!  Here's the catch though.  The phone is so well protected from the outside, it virtually keeps the outside out, so to speak.  It's very difficult to hear when using this cover.  You can't hear the phone ringing or feel it vibrating very well.  Speaker phone is very muffled as well.  For obvious reasons, bluetooth works just fine.  So when I'm in my car, the phone works perfectly for me.  In certain applications, this cover would be ideal.  For instance, if you were hiking in the rainforest or treking through creeks and waterfalls, this case is probably exactly what you're looking for.  For everyday use for the average person, I'm afraid folks might be disappointed.By the way, for those of you who could really use this phone, there's a waterproof plug in headset as well.  This is a great feature and one which would serve someone quite well in the right circumstances.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review37" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-06-26:</strong> We bought this in January the bottom cover by the head set jack broke off.

The plastic this case is constructed with feels and looks flimsy, especially the front facing cover which basically a thin sheet of plastic. I can squeeze the sides of the case and it bends inward very easy. It seems that if the phone was dropped on it's edge it would survive the drop but not a front facing drop. There is no way the thin sheet of plastic nor the very thin short edge would absorb the drop.The case comes with instructions that state you should do regular water tests with case without the iPhone in it by fully submerging the case in water and placing a cup (anything heavier than the case will work, I used a soap dispenser) on top of it. Keep the case submerged for an hour then check for any leaks. I tested the case when it arrived before I used it for the first time and it passed, no water leakage. I tested it again four days later but found a film of moisture on the inside opening of the door to the charging port door. I had not dropped the case at any time between tests and I made double sure both times that all openings were closed properly. With repeated opening and closing of the charging part door, the clip piece doesn't snap as securely as it did brand new.When the case is on the iPhone, it is cumbersome to select/type near the edges of the screen. I found myself having to press harder towards the edge of the screen or the iPhone didn't sense the touch, which I found aggravating while trying to type fast.If you use wired headphones, the case comes with a headphone adapter to plug your headphones into because the bottom edge is thick and the opening is small. But I found that the original headphones that come with the iPhone 5 was slim enough to fit into the opening without using the adapter. Which brings in another point of future failure for this case. The headphone port is covered by a plastic screw and the opening is threaded plastic, with repeating removing of the plastic screw will eventually nick the threading, especially the few times you screw in the screw wrong because it's easy to start screwing it in crooked.The silence button is hard to activate, I have to push hard to point I feel like I might break the switch. However the volume buttons are easy to use.Removing and putting the case on the iPhone is fairly easy, I've had cases that were a bear to take off and on.I think this case would be good for keeping debris off your iPhone but I can't with confidence recommend it as waterproof or impact resistant case,  especially for the price of this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review39" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-23:</strong> Shortly after receiving this Lifeproof case, I followed the directions and weighed it down under water for an hour. It looked dry inside afterwards, but I was suspicious - It is surprisingly light and thin. I opened it up expecting to find a few drops of water inside, but there were none. I then took it with me on a trip to Florida where, on the second day, I was pushed into a pool by a 'friend.' I had the phone in my pocket. My first thought was a reflexive "Oh, s...!" But, the phone came up high and dry!A very viable alternative to the very-heavy and heavy-duty Otterbox (which, I hear, has just purchased Lifeproof), the case is thin and light. It installs easily and is sealed with a simple O-ring gasket. As has been pointed out by others, the screen cover does reduce the touch sensitivity of the iPhone 5's screen but the buttons all work perfectly. The only structural awkwardness is with regards to the headset plug. It is, necessarily, covered with a screw-in plug. To use it, that plug gets removed and held in a contained secured on a screw-in plug extension cord that comes with the Lifeproof case.I tried it and it worked OK and although at first it seemed an inconvenience, I thought that wanting to listen to music while in the water was probably a silly idea, anyway! I plan to take it on all future trips but would probably not use it unless an anticipated situation was in the offing.While dramatically lighter than other options, the lightness, itself, seems suspect. It does not 'feel' like it could handle a hard drop - and I was not about to use my own iPHone to test this out. It looks and feels almost flimsy; But it's performance is not.For times when a sealed, enclosed case is necessary for your iPhone5, I thing this case makes a viable and, in some ways, preferable alternative to those heavy water-proof cases we have seen so many of. The price is quite steep - but if slimmer protection is the goal, this may be well worth the money to you.  Also noted: The 90 day warranty the case comes with is extended to a full year when you register it online.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review40" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-29:</strong> the plastic over the touch screen is the exact same plastic one finds in those hard to cut open blister packs.  The hard plastic edging does have fiddly indents wherever there is an outlet for the phone but if you know anything about overseas plastic injection factories, that's no justification for the high price tag.Bear in mind, that they can sell plastic nondisposable cameras for ten dollars with a lot more details and moving parts than this iphone cover.  It is literally a snap together NON waterproof blister pack for your iphone.It must be a joke product with a joke price tag, right?  Like those gallons of milk product pages on Amazon.April Fool's!p.s.  I had to remove the yellow foam sponge in the fifth picture (penultimate) in order to snap this ..."case" closed.  It's REALLY flimsy - I don't understand how this got more than two (and that's generous) stars.p.p.s. unlike a thick rubber case like a tough skin, I definitely do not feel that this case would not shatter if dropped and thereby allow the phone within to suffer damage as well.  Another CON to this case is god forbid someone should recognize it and think I paid $80 for something that isn't even an extended battery case cover.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review41" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-09-11:</strong> I received mine and promptly came to write a review... then I see all these FAKE!

If you are using a bluetooth OR if you open the charging door then people can hear you. I did not purchase this from Amazon or third party but from LifeProof so this is a genuine product.It does what it promotes except for one thing, talk to people (go figure a cell phone to actually talk to people).I'd advise people check the Seidio Obex which uses better screen technology than the plastic glue on popping screen LifeProof uses.

Waterproof, shock and impact resistant, if you are nervous about destroying your $600 smartphone through a moment's inattention (or getting caught in the rain on a run or bike ride) this case is a great option for you.The instructions and installation process for the phone are very well detailed.  If the Apple like packaging or instructions should confuse you, the Lifeproof website is pretty well done with more instructions and a good FAQ section.  I had my phone installed and ready to go in 20 minutes.  The Lifeproof case does not add much bulk and the screen and all the buttons work properly with the phone inside the case. I liked that charging with the Apple Lightning cable can be done with the phone in the case.There are a few things I didn't like.  The "everything" proof case requires that you use a somewhat clunky headphone adapter for most third party headphones or input cables (I had to use it for my Bose in-ear phones).  Also to get the full warranty you have to take a quiz on their website- and pass with 100%.  Really guys?Still, these are minor annoyances and I will keep using the case- especially on runs and long bike rides.

It makes texting much slower than I am used to.If you must have a really waterproof case - this is probably a good choice, but I can't imagine anyone using it for everyday use if they text.The kicker is that I couldn't hear my phone very well and so I returned it and am here to shop for a new case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review45" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-08:</strong> I have always used an Otterbox Defender with my iPhone.  I was shocked at the light weight of this product!  It is a little more difficult to remove, but the case is water resistant to 6+ feet and keeps out dirt/sand, etc.  You need a coin to open the case once it is shut (or something else to pry it open.  It was a little tricky the first time, but worked well afterwards.  In the box is a headphone adapter to keep the headphone port sealed, but still gives you the ability to use headphones.  This will be great for the beach.  With two young children, the more protection I can get for my phone, the better.  This is much lighter/sleeker than the Otterbox, provides protection for the screen itself.  The only minor quibble is you will want to make sure you have any tiny specks of dirt/lint cleaned before you seal it up.  It comes with a cleaning cloth, but I think a little screen cleaning solution will help keep any small pieces of lint off of it in the future.  I will be switching over to this case full time.  One note:  The AmazonBasics lightning cable does NOT fit the adapter port while the case is one - the base is too wide.  This does fit the standard regular lightning adapter cord and has a flap to open for easy charging.  The headphone port has a small screw you unscrew which I am going to try very hard not to lose! :)  (NOTE:  Because I have since lost the headphone port screw, I found out there is an extra screw attached to the headphone adapter.  Also, extras of both items can be ordered for relatively cheap on Amazon).UPDATE:  I got a 2nd case (in black) and for some reason that one (which I know was a legitimate Lifeproof case) was sometimes difficult for the other person to hear me.  I kept getting complaints that I sounded like I was underwater.  I think it's due to the way the microphone is obstructed by the waterproofing.  It's odd that the White & Gray case, which I used for a few months, did not have this issue, but the black one did.  Both were real (not counterfeit) cases obtained directly from Amazon.  I have actually switched back to the Otterbox since I (foolishly) gave my husband the gray case and others were having trouble hearing me with the black case.  My parents have used Lifeproof 4/4S cases for over a year and I have no issues hearing them.  So I don't quite understand why some are like this and others aren't.  I understand the mixed reviews - if you get a winner, it's amazing.  Otherwise, like me, you will get frustrated that no one can hear what you are saying.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review46" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-30:</strong> This is the second LifeProof case my teenager has used on his iPhone5.  The first one was only on for a few days because it bugged him.  We originally purchased that one for him thinking about the summer when he sails a Laser and is generally near or on the water all day.  At that time, LifeProof had better marketing than Otterbox.  They made better promises to me. Of course, it does not work if the kid won't keep it on his phone.He found this one improved because it is now usable with a shield under it.  Earlier versions a few months ago would not allow the shield to be left on.  On the other hand the belly button had to come off.  I asked him what the big deal with the shield was and he held it up and said, "This is the perfect shield.  It took me two days to get it on and it is never coming off."  Pffft.I tried to work out the big bubbles but he took it back from me and said the bubbles would work themselves out and to leave it alone.  Since I have never ever seen wishes make bubbles go away, I wondered how this would work.  By the next day, they had diminished considerably, although not completely.  He said the Newton rings were caused by having two screen protectors on it.This teenager changes cases like some people change shoes and this one is actually staying on the phone.

I have tested the case to make sure it is waterproof (with paper inside), and I did not have any leaks, but I would not recommend dropping your phone in a bucket of water. The only issue I have with this case is that it only works with narrow lightning cables, not with apple certified adapters or other cables; the case is too small and tight for most charging cables, and it requires one to take the case off to charge (unless its the cable that came in the original phone package).</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review48" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-14:</strong> I PURCHASED THIS ITEM BECAUSE OFTHE DESCRIPTION OF IT AND IT REALLY IS A GREAT PRODUCT .

Once you purchase the product, you will find an interesting disclaimer on the bottom of the box, here's what it says:IMPORTANT: This case is not indestructible and should be used with care. Case or phone may be damaged by drops less than tested height - particularly on non-smooth surfaces. We do not warranty that this case will protect your device in all circumstances - user exposes their device to hazards at own risk. User must follow all installation, maintenance, and operating instructions carefully for water, dust, and shock protection. Ensure all seals are properly closed before exposure to dust or liquids. Ensure complete closure and inspect case for damage after impacts. Under no circumstances will LifeProof repair or replace a damaged device. This case is not a substitute for regular backups or insurance.I know companies have to cover themselves from dumb users who always want to sue for everything, but the disclaimer pretty much tells you: Ok dude, whatever we said in our advertisement, may or may not work for you. If it does work, cool, you got lucky! If it doesn't, deal with it.Now, focusing on the product alone, I can tell you that upon receiving the product, packaging was awesome, I think they spent a big chunk of their money on it, looks good! Once I held the product in my hand, the quality did not feel much different for what I could get for a $20 case, I'm talking quality alone, I know this case has some features that cannot be found on a $20 case.This case is supposed to be water proof, dirt proof, snow proof, and shock proof (if you're lucky) but I was not going to risk my $600+ iphone for the sake of a review. I can tell you however, that it does look like it seals all the potential leaks.

It offers protection from water which is always an added benefit. This will help protect it from accidental drops in the toilet and now I can use my phone to take pictures and videos during mud runs and other races without worrying about water, mud, grime, and drops. The case snaps onto your phone giving it a nice tight fit and sealing together quite well. The screw in headphone piece and the charging connector protect those parts.  There are 2 raised parts around the side buttons which protect them from accidently getting hit. The case slides in and out of your pocket without snagging like some cases. The only drawbacks are the sound when listening to items without headphones is that it sounds a little distorted and you can hear the case vibrating a little. The screen does feel a little plasticky/waterproofy feeling but doesn't really bother me that much it just takes a little getting used to but is still very responsive to touches and swipes.

I also thought the flexible plastic covering the screen appeared cheap and might not work. The shell of the case doesn't look much different than other lower priced options out on the market; however, it's thinner and not as bulky as an OtterBox, so that was a plus for me.Ease of Adding/Removing the case 5/5: The case is actually pretty easy to remove and put back on. Just get a coin (a nickel or a quarter will do), insert it into slot on the right hand corner, and give the quarter a 1/2 turn. This will pop the case off without stretching or damaging it.Feel 4/5: While I was a little underwhelmed with this product at first, after using it for a day or two, I found myself getting used to the feel of the case. Knowing that it can also sustain a drop from up to six feet adds to the comfort.Ease of use 3/5: The phone is very easy to use even though it is completely sealed within the case. The volume buttons are very responsive. I sometimes forget if the volume on the ringer is on or off since the orange indicator is now covered. The one drawback is the headphones. I run frequently and headphones are a must. This case comes with a special extension wire that must be used in order to plug in your headphones. While I see this is necessary in to seal the phone, I would rather sacrifice it being waterproof and eliminate the special attachment. I have multiple pairs of headphones for work, running, and night time listening and I tend to forget where I left the plug-in.Overall 3.5/5: Despite the issues with the headphones, I like this case. It's durable yet slim. I like the protective screen covering which is very responsive to the touch.

While this LifeProof case is slimmer (less bulky), it just isn't rugged enough for me to feel safe with it on my handlebars during a 30+ mile ride at 15-20mph.  however, to be fair, I dont think the LifeProof case is designed for that.  It's designed to protect your iPhone from life's little mishaps.  To that, I'd also have to say that if you're looking for a phone case so you can take your iphone swimming with you, I would not suggest this.  While it does appear to be waterproof (I did the testing as indicator prior to use - the insides stay dried), I don't think it's designed for prolonged exposure to water.  One of the reasons I got this was because my last iPhone I did accidentally drop into water and that killed it - I had to plunk down $100 for another phone.The case itself reminds me of a Tupperware container - the lid basically fits on snugly, though it does seem very thin.  The rubber around the outside is a hard rubber or plastic, but not a tough, hard plastic, so it does have some "give" or shock-absorbency if you were to drop the phone with the case on it. (Though I'm not going to try that on purpose!)My quick Pros/cons of this case:Pros:+ slim, lightweight+ waterproof when used as designed/instructed (be sure to test first!)+ offers protection against accidental dropping+ hinged cover for the lightning charger adapter access (makes it easy to get to and the hinge may be able to last longer than an all rubber part would.+ great for every day general use/protectionCons:+ need to use the supplied adapter for plugging in headphones (I need it for plugging into the audio in my car - the cable won't go in without the adpater.+ not 100% waterproof if you forget to put the little plug back in after using headphones/earbuds/audio adapter.  And don't lose the plugs!+ the silent/ring switch on the side the phone is backwards with the case attached.  (Up is on/ring; Down is silent/vibrate).  This is because of the way it's made with a plastic hinged "toggle switch" inside the rubber outer ring of the case.  You also can't see where the switch is set just by looking at it when the case is on.+ not designed for long exposure under water (may be a "con" if you want to use your iPhone while swimming)+ does make the phone a bit bigger (longer mostly) so it doesn't fit into the leather case I have for attaching my phone to my pocket or belt.Overall this isn't really too bad of a case if you need some every day protection and are worried about dropping your phone into water.  I only gave it a 3 star because it's okay, and a good daily protection.  But, I connect my iPhone to the audio jack in my car every day to listen to audiobooks on my commute.  having to use the audio/headphone jack adapter and put the little plug back in is an extra step that I don't like - plus I've had to look for the little plug twice already as it's fallen under my car seat.  (thankfully I found it both times - and the case did come with two of them)  kind of a hassle, but I suppose that's one of the prices you have to pay if you want peace of mind protection for your iPhone.I still am sticking with my Otterbox Defender for use on my bike rides, though, but that is too bulky for every day use.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review56" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-29:</strong> Bought this for my clumsy girlfriend, and it's saved her phone a few times.The most recent was when she dropped her phone while at the go kart track.

However, I would use it if I was going to be around water (a vacation to the beach or water park) or camping, etc.Why?Well, keep in mind that in order to use the microphone or earphones, you have to unscrew the protective piece each time. You could leave that piece off, but then you don't get the full protection in case of water or dust, etc. The charging port isn't as bad because it just flips open instead of unscrewing.In order to use it in one of my running cases, I have to take it out of the Lifeproof case because it doesn't otherwise fit. And it's a pain in the rear to get out (and back in again). I definitely wouldn't want to be doing that on a daily basis.The front clear protector would not make full contact with the screen so it didn't allow for perfect operation when swiping. Again, not something critical if you're just taking your phone with you down the river on a canoe trip...but not something I would want to deal with all day every day.During the testing period, it never underwent any dust or water issues, but I do plan on using the phone when I deploy to Afghanistan in a month and will update my review then. As it stands, I cannot recommend this case for day-to-day use, but I would recommend it for extreme situations.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review58" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-20:</strong> Excellent case, I love these life proof cases, they seem to save my phone no matter what.

So if you want you 600 dollar iphone to stay safe and pretty, purchase this case. Just make sure to do the 1 hour waterproof test before you go thinking your phone is water proof. Simply but a stripe of paper in the case seal it, and leave it under water (weighted) for an hour, if the paper is not wet then you are good to go !</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review59" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-20:</strong> I tried the Lifeproof iPhone 5 case and found it to be a little too bulky for regular use. But, then again, it's not really intended for regular use. It's a "special occasion" cover, when you think it might be exposed to water, sand, mud, etc.It's impossible to place the phone with cover on the 30-pin to Lightning adapter to charge or play your phone off a speaker dock.After reading some of the reviews here that described water damage incurred during regular use, I decided not to give it a water test at all. The risks are too great. So I can't vouch for water safety.Also, the plastic screen cover doesn't lie flat and smooth enough to be used as effectively as I would like to control the touch screen. And the sound from the phone's speakers is muffled slightly by the cover. The sound from the iPhone 5 is usually great, but this just sounds garbled and muted.It may be good for someone who really needs to subject their phone to risky situations, but I'm just not willing to try that with this cover. I'll keep my phone out of the water and off the beach.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review60" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-27:</strong> I bought this after I had invested in a waterproof sleeve that required you to cut a hole for the charger cord. Dumb. My only complaint is the small tab on the underside of the front face causes the top to create bubbles and has to be taken off and reapplied. If that tab weren't there, it would no doubt lie flat, and there would be no bubbling. Otherwise this is a great case. I have had no cause to test the waterproof quality except for the test before I put it on, though.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review61" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-05:</strong> You should get this case ONLY if you absolutely must have a waterproof case - for keeping water out, it does a great job, although I have not tested it beyond the depth of a bathtub (it's rated to 6 feet). Unfortunately, due to the waterproofing quality, a lot of other qualities have to be compromised.The main issues for me are: The portion of the screen protecting the case doesn't sit flush with the screen, so some distortion is present, and I can feel a bit of gap when touching the screen. The quality of the music player off the speaker is also significantly muffled and distorted by the case. The case also feels a bit cheap (especially considering the price tag), though it certainly is waterproof.For everyday use, I'll stick to one of my other non-waterproof cases. This case will definitely be put on for those times I'm on a boat or hiking through creeks, etc.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review62" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-25:</strong> The LifeProof  plastic case for the iPhone 5 advertises itself as water proof, dust proof, snow proof and shock proof and it is durable, tight and almost weightless. It comes in attractive dark packaging with a clear understandable set of instructions, a white dust cloth and a headphone adaptor. This is ideal for the active Gen X iPhone user.

Is that really necessary?3) The accessories costs are also insult to injury.4) The case is a soft plastic, not rugged in appearance or feel which for me, loses points.5) The 3.5mm headphone jack becomes useless and requires their extra screw-in cord.

The Otterbox Defender was an option for me but it seemed extremely bulky to me.  The Lifeproof case strikes a reasonable balance between bulk and protections. Plus, it offers waterproof protection, something the Defender does not do.It's quite easy to fit your phone in this case.  Main thing is when you are putting the two halves together, make sure the whole shebang is sealed - the sides fit together with a Tupperware-type seal.  But once sealed, it's pretty solid.I did notice some minor gaps between the outer membrane and the screen, just around the edges.  It was barely a distraction for me, but again : design compromises...you aren't going to get waterproof performance with a sticky-type screen protector, at least not without a lot of usability headaches.Did I mention this is waterproof?  This lets you do all sorts of cool party tricks, like putting your ringer on vibrate, placing the phone in a tall glass of water, and then call your phone to watch your drink light up and vibrate across the table.The headphone jack cover needs some attention. Right now there's a screw-in plug with a rubber O ring that keeps the seal intact.  If you want to listen to headphones without removing the phone from the case, you unscrew the plug and then screw in an adapter cable, into which you then plug in your headphones.  It was difficult for me to get enough purchase on the plug to unscrew it, and of course you need to have the adapter cable handy with you (although this isn't THAT big of a deal...just leave it connected to the headphones you have with you anyway... ).  I kind of wish the plug somehow hinged into place instead of detaching completely, that way you don't run the risk of losing a rather important part of the case.I do like this case.  Call quality is very good, especially considering that you're talking and listening through a waterproof membrane.  Speaker quality is also terrific.  I honestly can't tell the difference between calls in the case vs those with a bare phone.It's light enough that it doesn't feel unreasonably bulky, but not so light that it feels flimsy.  I think it does strike the best possible design compromise given the protection it offers, especially the waterproofing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review66" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-22:</strong> I got this item to protect my iphone 5 when I go to the beach and/or any other outdoor activity.

Their case for the iPhone 5, while made entirely of lightweight plastic, is dirt proof, shock proof and even waterproof.The case takes a bit of effort to set up, including an hour-long test (without the phone) to make sure the water seal works, but the instructions are very simple and easy to follow. Once the phone is locked in, it sits pretty snugly, though you can still access just about everything you need. There is a screw in piece covering the earbud jack, which I suppose could be easy to lose if you're not careful. The touch screen still works perfectly, though it doesn't adhere to the screen so it's not quite flush. You can hear sounds through the seal, but they're not quite as clear as they'd be without it. The case is kind of bulky though, adding roughly  inch to the iPhone 5's already taller height.If you're accident prone, work in extraordinarily dusty areas or just really want to take your iPhone in a pool or hot tub, the Life Proof case is going to be a lifesaver. It would also be a brilliant short-term solution for camping trips, rafting and similar activities, but it may be a bit pricey just for occasional use. For everyday use though, this is probably more case than the average person needs.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review68" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> If you need a waterproof iPhone case to save you from those "Bonzai moments", this case fits the bill.  The case is advertised as completely waterproof and I tested and found that to be true.  After doing a practice run with no iPhone installed, I then installed my phone and submerged it underwater for 30 minutes.  I am relieved to report that no water reached the phone.The case is made of a hard black plastic in a matte finish.  There is some sort of waterproof mesh over the speaker and microphone openings.  This mesh stops water but allows sound to pass through.All of my iPhone 5 controls were easily accessible with this case installed.  The camera cut-outs were perfectly aligned.If you use your headphone jack, this case becomes hard to recommend.  To access the headphone jack you have to unscrew a "plug" and then screw in a small 3.5mm extender.  You can then connect into the headphone jack through this short extender cable.  The process is tedious and not worth repeating.  Therefore, unless you are able to get by with bluetooth and AirPlay, you might find this case very hard to live with.Fortunately, the lightning jack is much easier to get to.  The lightning connector has a plastic plug that you can pop out with your fingernail and then the lightning cable easily fits.Overall, I think it is a very good waterproof case, but be aware that it is best for those that use wireless technologies and don't rely on access to the headphone jack.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review69" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-19:</strong> The case seems to be just as good as the Otterbox.

My previous "go to" case used to be an Otterbox (I've had both the defender and the commuter) and before that the iSkin Revo.  This case is much slimmer than the Otterbox cases and provides more protection.  I enjoy the thinner case and the waterproof features.  I have kids and I'm always worried that my toddler will grab my phone and drop it in the dog's water, etc.  I was having problems with the Otterbox getting moisture/water underneath the screen protector from a tiny bit of water or even just my toddler mouthing my phone.Yes, there are occasional bubbles on the screen that are a little annoying when typing but in general, I find the screen to be more sensitive in this case than the Otterbox.  There is a slight bump by the front camera but that does not affect any usage.  You will loose a certain amount of speaker volume and there is a slight vibration when the phone is ringing.If you just need minor protection from very careful use, this is not the case for you.  If you want to take pictures underwater, not worry about dropping your phone, or are not "nice" to your phone then this is a great case for you.  You have to sacrifice some to get the benefit of ultimate protection of your phone.  I personally love taking pictures of my kids at the pool, underwater, playing anywhere and everywhere without concern.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review72" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-17:</strong> Lifeproof's case is absolutely a great choice if you need a waterproof case. Its design will protect your iPhone ingeniously and allow you to take it in the water and use the camera, etc.That being said, if you don't NEED a waterproof case, making a case waterproof has its drawbacks. For me, the main thing is the sound. The muffling and vibration were very distracting, almost like everything coming out of your phone (music, calls, etc.) are coming from under water. This wouldn't be such a big deal if the headphone jack was not (by necessity) difficult to access in the case. The screen cover also makes it more difficult (but not impossible) to use the phone.Overall, if you need a case that will protect your phone reliably from water (or dust or dirt) and you are okay with compromising some of the features of the iPhone to do it, this might be a great choice for you.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review73" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-07:</strong> I bought this since I was going to be traveling to NZ for over 2 weeks.

The buttons on the side still functioned and I was still able to charge the phone with a normal lightning cable. The only difficulty I had with the case was that the touch screen was a little less responsive but that was bearable and manageable if you pressed hard enough.

Please continue to read if your looking for the best protective and waterproof case on the market.I am reviewing the Lifeproof iPhone 5 Case - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Black. Although it is one of the more expensive protective cases offered, it still cost less than a couple of months insurance. When owning a $700+ phone, I want the beat protection without the size of an Otter Box. I have researched the dimensions of the case and the iPhone 5. These dimensions are listed below.The Lifepoof iPhone 5 case doesn't add much weight or size to the phone. The case dimensions without phone: Size (LWH): 5.41 inches, 2.64 inches, 0.48 inches,. Weight: 1.12 ounces.The iPhone without case: Height: 4.87 inches, Width: 2.31 inches, Depth: 0.30 inch. Weight: 3.95 ounces.*The Lifeproof iPhone 5 Case AND the iPhone 5 combined dimensions are:Length - 5.41 inches. Added length = 0.54 inchesWidth - 2.64  inches. Added width = 0.33 inchesDepth - 0.48 inches. Added depth = 0.18 inchesWeight difference = 1.12 oz. and with case & iPhone =  5.07 oz. total.* I took these dimensions from Apple & Lifeproof official web sites.For me when choosing a protective phone case I look for the best protection while considering the size. I carry my phone in my front pocket and I need something that is slim and light weight, not a cumbersome foam Otterbox. The Lifeproof case suits my needs while providing the best possible protection. &#34;LifeProof fr for iPhone 5 is the thinnest, lightest, strongest all-protective case ever created.&#34;I have done a few light self test such as dropping on concrete from 5ft, under water for 3 seconds, tossing it about 7-8 ft and not one single scratch or problem. I tried the same tests on my daughters iPhone 4S with a otter box case and of course with all that foam on the otter box no problems either.In conclusion, if you're like me and wants the best protective slim case on the market or if you like the sleekest design that enchants your beautiful state of art iPhone then get the Lifeproof Case. If you're like my daughter and carries her phone in a bag or purse and doesn't mind the bulk or outdated design of the Otter Box then save about $35 and go with otterbox.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review79" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-08-05:</strong> I have this for my iPhone 5 and was happy with the water protection and drop protection it provided for my phone along with a few extra things.

If you shatter the glass, it can be replaced (for a hefty fee), but short of cracking the whole phone in two (which doesn't happen even if a car runs over it!  My wife learned this from experience), water appears to be the kryptonite death from which there is no return.I really liked the idea of a Lifeproof case because it seems to have a full line of stuff associated with it: skins likePink Leopard "Protective Decal Skin" for LifeProof 5 Case(if pink leopard is your thing), aLifeproof 1333 Bike Mount for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Black, evenLifeproof 1335 Arm Band for iPhone 5 - Retail Packaging - Black(though I have found that theSport Armband for Otterbox iPhone 5 Defender Series Case (fits many iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S / 4 Protective Cases)works just fine).  Basically, this accessory has accessories.[Update 25 APR 2013] I just discovered that through the lifeproof website, you can get Skinit cards to change the look of your case whenever you want.  This is AWESOME!  It's a bit clunky, however. [End update]The screen protector is also nice, since I don't have to actually glue rhino skin or anything else onto the front glass.  That sort of thing makes me incredibly nervous when applying, and it doesn't come off.  Since I plan to sell this someday, I want to have this in as close to factory original state as I can!  The screen protector makes everything a bit less responsive at the edges of the screen, which has so far only been an inconvenience when playing Angry Birds.The biggest problem: it feels CHEAP.  MyOtterBox Defenderprovides a textured soft rubber case that goes over the rigid shell.  It's huge, but feels like the phone is protected from just about anything.  This on the other hand, has a smooth plastic that feels like it's going to slip from my grasp, and not protect it from anything (that's perception only though: I've dropped it a few times already, and everything appears fine).  The fact that it takes up less room than the defender in my pocket is a plus.There's also an issue with getting things into the port.  My original apple power cord works, but myAmazonBasics USB A to Lightning Compatible Cable (3 Feet/0.9 Meter)doesn't fit through the case!  That's probably Amazon's fault for not meeting the specs to the millimeter, but if it happens for one 3rd party device, it could happen for others.I don't use the speakerphone, or even the headphone jack, since I have bluetooth everything.Given that I already have this, I'm not sure if I will stick with it or go back to the Otterbox.  On the other hand, if you're trying to decide whether to buy this or that, it's hard to justify the extra cost of the Lifeproof: just keep the phone away from water.  And I'd ditch them all if a rugged battery case ever came out!  Mophie's Juice Pack Pro is only available for the 4/4S form factor, not the new elongated one of the 5.[Update May 23rd, 2013] Some colleagues who bought the lifeproof case complain that the fascia that covers the power port has broken off.  They have not yet tried contacting Lifeproof to see if this is covered by their warranty.

When you put it together to use as a phone, it totally ruins the experience of the capacitive touch screen of the i-phone 5. I did the waterproof test and it worked and I thought that was amazing but why do I not want to trust my phone to this sort of flimsy feeling product?  Perhaps because my phone is a 699 dollar phone and Life_Proof is offering no warranties on damage.  Sorry, it just doesn't feel as tough as my Otterbox.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review88" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-23:</strong> While I have no doubts on the shock protection provided by the case, the thin and flimsy plastic leave me worried - build quality is certainly questioned here. So no I didn't test out if its waterproof. With one feel there was NO way I would test that out. What I can say that it provides bulk where Bulk is not wanted. And it looks no better... If protection and having a waterproof case are paramount go with this case. If you desire a thinner yet protective case try something else like the incipio dual PRO.3/5 stars -1 star for bulk and -1 star for flimsy plastic (build quality)</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review89" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-31:</strong> I was a bit incredulous when I first heard about this case. However, when I received it and opened the attractive and informative packaging I began to think that they might actually be onto something here. Performed the recommended leak test with a slight modification of my own. I inserted a folded facial tissue into the case before submerging it in the kitchen sink for an hour or so and was pleasantly surprised when I opened the case (something that's understandably a bit difficult) to find it absolutely bone dry. I then inserted my iPhone 5 and found that all controls and ports operated just fine and that there was little to no "lag" when using the touch screen. I do agree with others here that the case isn't the most attractive one out there and that they've done a much better job of making it waterproof than they have at making it a tactile masterpiece. We do a lot of kayaking in the summer so I'm going to keep this case for those excursions but won't be using it for my everyday carrying as I just don't like the way that it looks or feels nearly as well as the Magpul field case that I've been using. So, if you're into water sports, I can highly recommend this case although I'm still not certain that I'd feel really comfortable taking my phone swimming or water-skiing.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review90" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-11-10:</strong> This is a great case the white and gray is really sharp looking.

When I had the opportunity to try out the iPhone 5 version, I jumped at the chance to see what $80 buys in an iPhone case. When I unpacked it I first noticed how flimsy the unit felt. the plastic is lightweight and flexes when unassembled. That gets somewhat better when the phone is placed in the case. The unit is totally waterproof - the two halves snap together. If you need to take it apart it can be done with a minimum of effort.While the fit and finish are first -rate and of high quality, I worry whether the plastic nubs that lock the case together will weaken over time. The instructions require you to assemble it (sans iPhone) and sink in a bowl of water for at least an hour. If the interior stays dry, you're good to go. The membrane that seals the front of the phone was pretty decent. However, I (as others have done) did not take off my screen protector and suffered a little less sensitive finger control until  I removed it. The sound enhancement system was not really a system or enhanced - the device adds a bit of volume to compensate for the loss of sound by covering the speakers, but I can't say it is "enhanced". The sound is tinny. The unit comes with a separate sealed connector to connect headphones - also totally waterproof. You need to use a separate dongle and it comes with a plug to keep the phone dry when no headphones are plugged in.I like phone cases with belt clips and this unit does not come with one. They do sell an optional belt clip, the Lifeproof 1331 Belt Clip for iPhone 5, which retails for $49.95. While it also looks first-class; combined they cost just under $130 for the pair. I can buy a case with a belt clip for $5.00.If you have a need to use your phone in extremely damp (or wet) conditions this may be your only option, but if, like most of us, you are more concerned about protecting your phone from day-to-day shocks and bumps, this is probably not worth the money. While it is well-engineered (except as noted) and well-made it is way too expensive. I'd expect to pay maybe $30 for this case... not nearly $80.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review93" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-21:</strong> Those who work in dusty parts of the country/dusty jobs (construction, etc.) will really appreciate the fact that this case does truly seal your phone and prevent dirt and dust from compromising its function.  Those who work or play on or around the water (or who might drop their phone into water) will appreciate the water-proofing (although I think you would have to be crazy to take an $800 phone along while snorkeling, I know many people have dropped their phones into a sink, bucket, bathtub, or puddle).If you take your phone on a boat, carry it while doing maintenance around water, or use it in a dust bowl-like area, this case might be worth the money and the functional compromises its design causes.  However, for the average person this case is overkill and a bit of a disappointment.  It is **extraordinarily** expensive and does not seem to provide superior impact protection when compared to the Otterbox Defender (maybe comparable to the Otterbox Commuter?).  Previous reviewers have detailed problems with microphone access and the iPhone 5's noise cancelling software (as well as potential fixes).  But overall I think the deterioration in sound quality, difficulty in using the speakerphone, and decreased screen sensitivity make this case a poor choice for most people.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review94" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-03-23:</strong> would recommend this case they are costly more than I wanted to spend but they are wife proof phone still works great</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review95" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-02-19:</strong> I have the white one and bought his one for my best friend.

It kept the water out, but we had to make sure it was in the shade or the phone (iphone 4) would overheat.This is a nice option for water use.  I can put it on my phone before a paddle or boat ride and still put it in my pocket.  The sound is not great, but I don't have to take it out of the bag to make or receive a call, which was the biggest problem with the other options.  I do not keep it on my phone for daily use as it is a pain to plug in the headset, etc. and the sound quality is not great.  I am happy to take the minute required to install the case before going on the water as I feel confident that it will protect the phone from another accident.

I guess it would also do well in rainy areas, places where dirt tends to get all over/in the phone and for folks, like my wife, who tend to drop their phone in the toilet a lot for some crazy reason.The case material feels like a thin tupperware with an O-ring, and I thought that it functioned pretty impressively for being a watertight case! The silent switch is still easy to operate. The charging port flap easy to open/close. They even managed to make the sound from the speakers to permeate which, while it sounds a bit muffled, is a pretty impressive feat of engineering in my book!The biggest downside is that it's a little awkward to use the headphone jack. Either you have to unscrew a watertight plug, or use an included attachment that leaves a short bit of extension cord dangling about.It also doesn't feel like the shock absorbency would be quite as robust as the thicker, rubbery-er Otterbox-style cases, but given how well the naked iPhone 5 seems to survive drop tests on YouTube, there's probably not a whole lot to worry about anyway.Anyway, this is a great case for anyone who wants to protect their phone from water and/or heavy dust that would otherwise make its way into the iPhone's open ports.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review98" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-03-19:</strong> Love it ....

The phone basically can't hang-up a call. I suspect the face proximity sensor doesn't work or the way the screen protect touches the screen messes up the multi-touch. I am not sure but this problem is so annoying when you get voicemail and there is no one to hang-up the other side of the call. I had this case on my iPhone 4 and it worked great in this regard.I would also add that these cases are splash proof not waterproof. Trying going to the bottom of the pool and water will trickle in. They are fine in a foot or so of water but not good for anything deeper than that. For $15 or $20 I would say it's fine, expect for the hang-up problem. But got $80 this is a total waste of money, it's a fantastic idea but it just doesn't work very well.An average rating of two or three stars for a $80 case should give you warning enough.

The instructions tell you to test it by soaking it in water for an hour prior to use.  I did so, and it is in fact 100% water proof (at least in a couple of inches of water.)  I seem to recall that it is rated to 1 or 2 meters, so this doesn't give a diver a solution, but it will prevent accidents, or casual soaking.  It is also quite sturdy.  I didn't want to subject my phone to a drop test, however it does seem like it would withstand a fall from a desk or similar.If you need those capabilities, it appears that it would work well.There are some caveats:Its not the prettiest case on the planet.  In fact, its quite "plasticy" and cheap feeling.  My son has an Otterbox case for his iPhone 4, and this case feels much cheaper, even though they target a similar market.Because it is totally sealed, you lose the visual indicator of the ring silent switch.  It (and all the other buttons for that matter) still work quite well, but you can't tell if you're on vibrate with a quick glance.You lose a little something with the screen.  I'm not sure how to describe it, but the screen isn't quite the same as a naked screen.Voice calls and any sound through the speaker are muted.There is a cover over the lightning port that works quite well.  I wonder about its life.There is a screw in port for the headphone jack that doesn't work so good.  The microphone does work through it, but the MFi controls don't work.  It's also a pain to have to carry and use the dongle.  Like I said, if you need the fully waterproof, this is something you can probably live with.All in all, if you need this case, it does deliver.  If you don't need a fully waterproof case, I'd keep looking.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review105" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-04:</strong> I will dispense with all of the bits about the case's dimensions and such as it has been done and get to the nitty gritty.Appearance:The case is slim, slightly bigger than the iPhone and very nice looking as well.Waterproof:The case is absolutely waterproof. I kept it underwater overnight, per the instructions with no leaks, so I put the iPhone 5 in it and submerged it overnight (I have the insurance, so I took the risk for the review), and am happy to report there were zero, yes zero leaks. No, it didn't ruin my iPhone. I even connected the dongle and listend to music while the phone was submerged...flawless.Dustproof:I had the phone out in the desert for two days. Had in in my pocket while dirtbiking. Had it on a four-wheeler. Left it sitting on the truck in the wind and dust. after two days in the desert...no dust in the case.iPhone finish after being in the case:I have to admit this was a concern, based on the appearance of the inside of the case. Though after two weeks in the case, there isn't a mark on the phone.Working the touchscreen:I have not had one single issue with the touchscreen. My face has not errantly done anything during a call. Every single touch/swipe/pinch has been flawless. I do not have another screen protecter on the phone, per the instructions.Call quality with speakerphone and with without (non Bluetooth or headset):The speakerphone has been flawless, with one caveat. You must go into the accessibility settings and put the iPhone 5 in hearing aid mode. This turns off the noise cancelling and allows the front mic to still work for video. Once done I have had no problems at all with calls on speaker. Everyone has heard me fine and I hear very well. It seems the hearing aid mode also gives a volume bump. I admit, this was not in the instructions, but I did find it online, as my Griffin and Otterbox cases that completely enclosed the phone had issues with speaker. I am happy to report that this fix worked for the Lifeproof case as well.  Non-speaker calls have been perfert. I can hear the other person perfectly and they can hear me perfectly. I have not had a single issue with that.Call quality with headphones:I have not had an issue with Bluetooth or earbuds for calls.Photo/Video quality:I can not detect a difference in the quality of photos with the case on or off. I compared them on the iPhone screen, sent to an Android phone, and on a computer monitor, both with a photo viewer and in Photoshop. I cannot detect a difference in video quality either. The sound isn't muffled.Drops:The case does not have the rubber/silicone of the Griffen or Otterbox which does give a sense of security in drops. I have dropped the phone with the Lifeproof case from about 4 feet and neither the phone nor the case suffered damage.Yes, the case is expensive, but not much more than the Griffin or Otterbox cases and they add considerable bulk to the phone, making it quite bulky in the pocket. Also, it is truly waterproof, not just water resistant. Using headphones requires a little extra work due to the waterproofing, but it's not a big hassle. I like it enough, that the Griffen and Otterbox are in a drawer and the Lifeproof Fre is on the iPhone!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review106" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-04:</strong> I was delighted that this case was offered just before a trip to Disney. I did the recommended "water test" in the sink at Disney's Beach Club and confirmed the case stayed dry inside.

It was great to know that I did not have to worry about my phone being destroyed, and the case is no bigger than the non-waterproof protective case I had been using.ProsWaterproofLightweight and adds very little to bulk of the phone, especially for a waterproof case.ConsThere is a spacer of some sort which keeps the top part of the screen separated from the iPhone's screen which is odd and requires a little more pressure on the top of the screen to register on the iPhoneOverall, I am very happy with this case.

After reading so many negative reviews, I was hesitant, but figured I'd try it and return it if I wasn't happy.  Keep in mind, I bought mine from the Verizon store- there are apparently some issues with counterfeit cases on Amazon.Most of the issues people state are because they are not being reasonable with their expectations.  Muffled speakers?  It's a waterproof case.  Take the case off if you want to play music.  Cheap/thin plastic?  If it were any thicker, people would complain about bulkiness.  The case fits precisely and works well.  I have no problem with call quality or screen function.I work on a very large equine medical facility, so having a shock resistant and waterproof phone is a must for me- it finally allows me to have an iphone, something I've always leaned toward.  Further, being a woman, I need a phone that will fit in my pocket.  Otterbox cases are simply too large.  Seriously- it is a waterproof (guaranteed) case for one of the most delicate phones on the market.  If that's important enough to you, you'll gladly deal with slightly diminished functionality.Most people simply do not need this much protection.  If you work in an office building or aren't terribly outdoorsy, a plain TPU or candyshell case and maybe a screen protector will do.  But if you're hard on phones like I am (water and dirt contact are completely unavoidable), then you'll likely be willing to sacrifice some features and looks to protect your investment.  Overall, for a waterproof case, this fits well, maintains full functionality, feels quite sturdy on the phone and keeps a slim profile- I'm really not sure what else you could ask for.  As for call quality, there is some loss of clarity, but I have not yet had anyone say they couldn't hear me quite clearly.  The only comment (when asked about the quality) was that there was a slight echo, but volume and clarity were fine.The only real criticism I have is that it took an hour and a half to register the warranty with this case; first the waterproofing test, then a long series of requirements (picture of the receipt, screen shot of the specifications, etc).  I'm sure that this is mainly to limit faulty claims, but still just about drove me crazy.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review109" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-04-25:</strong> This Lifeproof iPhone 5 case is great if you need a waterproof case.

Swapping out phone cases isn't something I typically do - with each of my previous phones, I've purchased only one case and used it for the duration of my use of the phone.  However, it's been a bit more challenging to find an iPhone 5 case that works for me.  The Lifeproof case is, by far, my preferred case for the following reasons:-It's waterproof - while I don't do any extreme water sports, my husband had to replace his brand new phone when our toddler put it in the cat's water bowl - Lifeproof will prevent something like this from happening-It's a complete case - no need to purchase a separate screen protector as the phone fits secure inside of the case-I've found that all of the phone's features work just fine inside of the case-It's durable - the phone will likely be fine after a fall (and the case will likely be fine, too)The only feature I don't love about it is that it requires a headphone adapter to be able to use headphones. I often forget to take the adapter with me, which means I need to forego using the phone with my headphones or I need to take it out of the case to use it.Overall, it's a great case!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review114" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-30:</strong> For my needs, I think that this case is definitely overkill.  However, I would recommend it for a person who is more abusive to their phone, or takes it near water.If you want to use a pair of earphones or the microphone, it is necessary to unscrew a protective piece of the case each time.  I regularly listen to music on my phone, so that is a real bother to me.  The screen protector that covers the actual phone screen is wavy, and slightly distorts the display of the iPhone.  It also makes the touchscreen significantly harder to use.After a few days, I had enough of this case and reverted to using this case:SPIGEN SGP SGP10089 Slim Armor Case for iPhone 5 - 1 Pack - Retail Packaging - Gunmetal.  For my needs that case is protective enough, much lighter, less bulky, and does not impede the functions of my phone.  In addition, it's significantly less expensive than the Lifeproof case.  However, comparing the two different cases is like comparing apples to oranges.  It all depends on what kind of protection you need for your phone.  I will probably put this case back on my phone the next time I go boating, or to the beach.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review115" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-26:</strong> I have had two of these cases.

But then I sent it back and got a new one and it has worked with talking to people and ending calls. I have not had one problem not being able to end a call. I love this case. It is definitely worth the money to keep my phone safe from water and dropping it and I have dropped it a lot. It has saved my life many times. I love this case.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review116" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-06-03:</strong> Let me start by saying...THIS IS NOT AN EVERYDAY CASE.So I guess I should qualify that statement.  The case is nice.  I haven't tested dropping the phone with the case, but it looks every bit as durable as the Otter Box.  But it isn't an everyday case because of the screen protector.  To be waterproof, the screen protector is built into the case.  So it floats a bit over the screen.  And for everyday use, I find the screen protector quite annoying.  It isn't as responsive to touch, and it makes viewing the screen difficult...especially under bright situations.That being said, this is a rugged case that provides a reasonable amount of water-proofness.  So if you spend a lot of time at or near water, this case would be very useful.  If you surf, boat/fish, swim, you could use this phone case to stay connected.  And considering the current class action law suit with Apple's faulty water sensor, not sure I would want my iphone 5 (most likely still under warranty) that close to water.This is a very nice case for the extreme sportsperson.  If you think you could possibly expose your phone to water and don't mind having a floating sheet of plastic in front of your actual screen...then this case may work for you.  But personally, I'm just not that extreme.  And when I do surf or mountain bike...I tend to leave my phone in my car.  When I ski, I'm pretty comfortable that my ski jacket will prevent any water exposure.  So personally, I don't see myself using this too much.  Maybe I'll use it when I'm going fishing or to the ocean...just to be safe.  But for everyday use, nah.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review117" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-25:</strong> For the most part, the Lifeproof iPhone 5 case is everything you could want in phone protection: lightweight, not bulky, protects from falls of over 6 feet, fully submersible and waterproof, and wraps your phone in a protective cocoon.Despite this, the case has a few shortcomings. The most notable one is the inability to charge while in the case. The instructions state you are able to charge without removing case through a flip-down latch at the bottom. However, I was unable to get the iPhone factory charger or a secondary market cord to fit well enough to charge it. This is a big deal, as the case isn't the easiest to take offhand on, and it leaves it unprotected while charging.The other issue is the plug on the audio out outlet. It screws in the hole in the case, and you have to unscrew and replace with the included extending cord that screws into place, allowing for waterproof listening. Or you can just put your cord in, but not have the sealed case environment. Either way, it's a pain to remove every time you want to use headphones.Despite these issues, I still very much like the case and will use it. The price is steep, but will hopefully come down.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review118" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> I really wanted to like this case as I thought it would give me the ultimate protection for my iPhone 5.  However, the proprietary headphone jack cable that you must carry around with you and the ultra small hole for the lightning connector proved to be too much of a negative for me.I found this case to have the following PROS:*  Well made with quality materials*  Easy to assemble or disassemble considering the tolerances of the fit, which are tight*  Protective screen cover doesn't cause any delay in touch responseI found this case to have the following CONS:*  Proprietary headphone jack connector*  Headphone jack connector must be carried with phone at all times if you wish to use the jack.  They could have made this optional so if you wanted to use it without the connector, you can.*  Headphone jack connector is $20 for an extra one; only available from them.*  The hole for the charge port is too small.  It only fits Apple OEM plug.  Aftermarket plugs, such as the awesome 6ft RND lightning cable I bought Amazon don't fit, so you can't use them.So, if you never plan to use the headphone jack and you use nothing but the OEM lightning cable, this case may work for you.  However, if either of those are a factor for you, I would look elsewhere.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review119" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-10-11:</strong> Unsurpassed protection. Deep earphone well unusable with most jacks.  To compensate, Lifeproof provides an adapter cord to screw into the case preserving water protection.  More dongles to fuss with.  I put the adapter cord in my parts drawer and use a blue tooth headset.  The worst compromise is the poor microphone pickup through the case screens.  Even leaving the sync plug port open still leaves everyone I speak to, saying I'm breaking up.  Pop the phone out of the case and issue goes away.

Yes, the phone's screen and camera continue to work well with the phone in the case, but with multiple mikes for sound cancellation, the phone is rendered useless inside the enclosed area of the case. When switched to speaker phone, people on the other end can now hear me, but the sound is muffled and somewhat garbled. Cell phone voice clarity is bad enough to begin with... adding this case makes it much worse.That said, if you must have a waterproof case, this one should keep your phone dry, even when using headphones (with the included adaptor). Of course, using headphones would be the solution to the audio issue as long as the earbuds you're using have a mike as well; but who wants to use headphones all the time?But when it comes to waterproofing, here's the catch I haven't seen mentioned in other reviews: the warrantee for this case does not cover repair or replacement of a phone that is damaged while inside the case. Their solution is backing up the phone regularly and getting insurance to cover the phone. I can do that with a $5 case.The company expects the user to do a one-hour water test with the case empty. Why the company does not do this test when they charge $56-80 for the product is beyond me.Although the case includes a built in screen protector, breakage protection of the screen is afforded by a thin plastic bezel that will only protect the screen from a drop to a flat surface; an uneven surface could easily hit the exposed glass screen and a screen protector is not meant to prevent breakage, only scratches. This is a common problem for nearly all cell phone cases since the face needs to be exposed to see and use the touch screen, which means this case is no more protective of the screen than a $5 case with a screen protector.Bottom line, this is an over-priced waterproof case with audio problems and no guarantee that it will protect your phone. Since it should keep your phone waterproof and it is possible to use the phone function with headphones and mike, I bumped it up to 2 stars, but I will not be using it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>2</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review121" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-07-18:</strong> I love my Otterbox Defender case for it's extended durability, drop after drop, but it is not water proof. That's where my mixed feelings lay with this case. This case will water proof your phone and keep it usable, versus some of the ziploc style bags which also provide water protection but hamper regular use. My concern is that after a drop or bump in the Lifeproof case, you really have to take the phone out and do a water test to make sure the waterproofing capability hasn't been compromised. Then you have to be careful with all of the seals when you reassemble the case with the phone inside and hope it will keep the water out.I think if the case were a little beefier, like the Otterbox Defender, while retaining the waterproofing, I'd feel a bit better about paying the higher pricing for this case. I don't have the Lifeproof case for the iPhone 4 anymore but I did notice this version has a place to attach a lanyard to one corner, where I would recommend attaching a floating wrist strap, like theVivitar YELLOW Floating Wrist Strap for UnderWater/WaterProof Camerasto the case for extra protection and increased retrievability. Our use is primarily river tubing, so we need splash/dunk protection while chancing a bump or two on river rocks should it make it into the water.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>3</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review122" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-05-07:</strong> This cases work great!

All have worked very well.  I did do one exchange with the iPhone 5 because there was a misaligned section of the screen protector, but the replacement did not have this problem, and all my devices get wet fairly regularly.I use my iphones when running and sweat up a storm.  So much so that "water resistent" cases I've purchased in the past did not protect the phone from the sweat and humidity that my sweat produces.  I also run in the rain a lot, so I was doubly in need of a waterproof phone.  My iPhone 4 cases worked flawlessly time and time again, and the iPhone 5 case continues the confidence.  I've taken this on runs in very hot weather, and also in downpours where my runs lasted two hours.  In all situations, no water has leaked in.If there is one flaw to the LifeProof cases (and this seems true of all the cases I've purchased is heat.  If you use the phone a lot, it tends to get warm, but if you use it a lot outdoors on a sunny day, the iPhone can get too hot to use (which shuts the phone down for safety).  I've had this happen to me a number of times with the cases on.  So much so that I have to remove the case.  It's easy to mitigate this effect by keeping the iPhone in an enclosed holster, but regardless, a fully enclosing ase on an iphone does not help with heat dissipation.Other than that, though, I have been very happy with the LifeProof case.  If they come out with a bad product, then I'll avoid using it, but so far, so good.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review125" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-01-24:</strong> Everything about this case is great besides the screen protector.

So, when I go to the beach or the pool, this is the case my phone will be in while I'm there....but I'll be taking it RIGHT OUT when I'm done.This case is the best at being useable and pocketable while being WATER PROOF, but you don't want to live with it every day.It turns out that making an iPhone waterproof makes it difficult to use.  You can still switch to vibrate, but the switch is hard to use.  You can use headphones, but you have to unscrew a plug and use an adapter and screw the plug into the adapter so you don't lose it.  You can do all the touch screen stuff, but the waterproof cover will probably scratch easily and isn't stuck to the screen so it feels funny and taps against the glass.  You can use the camera, but the pictures are blurry/distorted because there is plastic over the lens.  You can listen to the (phone's) built in speaker, but the sound is muffled because there is a waterproof diaphragm over the speaker.The engineers at Life Proof did a great job selecting materials that absorb a lot of impact while being thin, and the buttons feel very good considering that they have to stay water tight over two years of daily use.  The speaker diaphragm is ingenious. You'll just have to buy one and check it out.  Also, you can use headphones while maintaining the case's water proof properties, which is great.If you need a waterproof case, this is the one to get, but you will also need an every day, not at the pool case.  This isn't both.  I have a Switcheasy for every day and this one for the pool & beach.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review127" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2014-04-22:</strong> Oh my goodness.

For me, I don't really have a huge need to encase my iphone in such a large, protective case that houses it from dust, water, dirt, etc. If I had, then perhaps this would get a better review.First, it looks nice, and does seem to protect the iphone well. I haven't submersed it in water to check its waterproof-ness. The thing that bothers me the most is that I love how thin and minimal my iphone 5 is and this makes it feel huge! I don't like that. Plus, I've dropped my phone many times in a regular, minimal case and haven't had any issues. (when it finally breaks, though I'm sure I'll be wishing I had this case on it!). If you KNOW you are going to be outside in adverse conditions, this might be worth putting on your phone.... but (for me) not for everyday use. Plus, to charge it in its case you need an adapter. (included).All in all, if you need such heavy duty protection on your phone, this might be the perfect case for you.

We're not planning on taking it scuba diving or any thing like that, but we did want protection from accidental drops into puddles and from the sand that somehow always accumulates in a 12 year old boy's pocket.So far, the phone seems well protected.  I haven't found any sand getting into the case, which is great because sand can be really destructive.Like the other "military grade" cases we have used on iPhones over the years, there is a bit of a loss of quality for sound and pictures.  It's not tremendous and no worse than the Griffin Defender I had on my iPhone 4, or the otterbox I have on my other iPhone 5.  Same with photos - very slightly lower quality in lower light situations, like the Griffin case (my otterbox doesn't cover my camera lens).The screen cover is fine, certainly as good as the Griffin I'm used to.  Of course a screen cover is not going to have a display that's as brilliant as a naked iPhone, but then a naked iPhone is very vulnerable.I'm please with the lower profile this case has.  It's much easier to put this phone in a pocket.  I also like the construction, as it's easier to deal with than the two-layer silicone and hard plastic cases.So yes, there are slight concessions in appearance, call quality and photo quality, but in my opinion, it's no worse than their competitors and is the price you pay for protection.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review132" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-12-03:</strong> People leaving reviews about this product need to do a better job of rating the right product. This is a place to review the Lifeproof Fre case, as fulfilled by Lifeproof. This is not a place to review some knock off product that you bought for $7 and wonder why you got a fake. This is a great, AUTHENTIC Lifeproof case. Purchase a lifeproof case that is being sold by Lifeproof and you get what you order. This case goes on easy (a little difficult to take off) and is SUPER slim. I have only had Otterbox Defender cases for my iphones in the past, and I loved them. With my iphone in the Lifeproof case it feels half the size as when in the Otterbox. I now have a young child at home and spills are frequent so I wanted to have my phone in something that would protect against an accidental drop OR spill. If you do not need the waterproof functionality of this case you will still love the thin profile as compared to other cases. One thing to note: The packaging has not been updated and it says you will receive two headphone hole plugs. The new design has the plug tethered to the case itself, so no back up plug is needed. I assumed this was the case but confirmed it on a call to Lifeproof customer service. It is frustrating that people are leaving bad reviews and dragging the rating down for this product, when they are rating a fake product that was not sold by Lifeproof.

This is a solid case, and contrary to other's reviews is very solid and well built. Doesn't feel "cheap" at all. This is the number one reason I am keeping it and returning the Seidio. It passes water tests time and time again with no leaks (mind you, I've taken it apart and back together at least 10 times already.)Very nice, confidence-inspiring clips every time it goes back together. Not so with the Seidio OBEX.Sound quality is just fine (for calls), I can hear people just fine and they can hear me as well.Screen response is perfect. I have a screen protector installed on the phone itself, and the case works just fine with it- I'd even go as far as comparing the touch response to that of a naked iphone screen.Sound from the phone speaker is audible but very muffled, but what do you expect from a case like this? Tired of seeing this as a 'con' to people.The vibrate switch is reversed but works just as good as the actual phone's switch- this was another con for the Seidio OBEX, the plug they use is terrible.Bottom line- this case works great.

It might be kind of a pain for some, but at least it's there.- How thin it is, yet gives you lots of protection. There are so many cases that give you good protection but double the weight of the product.- The translucent window in the back that allows you to see the Apple logo. I don't think that is such a big deal, but I guess some people have to have that logo peeking through somewhere.-Ooh, 9 colors to choose from.Some of the things I'm dislike:-The speakerphone and audio sounds sort of tinny and muffled.-The screen responsiveness can be iffy on the edges.-Price, whoa.In summary, the big thing you're paying for is making the case waterproof. You can get the other features in other cases, such as Otterbox, and for a lot less money. If you don't need waterproof, you're better off looking at the competitors.**A word of warning: the company suggests you submerge the empty case for an hour in water to test it. I would think it should be waterproof since that's the claim, but considering how expensive iPhones are, I wouldn't skip this part.

First, I must say that I have unfortunately become an expert on iPhone cases, as I have purchased so many.  Each one that I have used--before this one--I have not liked for a variety of reasons.  I have tried all the styles of the Otter Box and I must confess that Otter Box cases are really ugly.  I get tired of the color within a few weeks but don't discard them since they are so expensive.  The screen protectors on the Otter Box work for a short period of time.  The problem with them is that they cannot be cleaned so the screen protector becomes useless once it is soiled since it is hard to see through it at that point.  The Otter Box's without screen protectors are better and not as bulky as the more rugged versions, but they lack a screen protector so I end up paying to buy a screen protector.  The Otter Box covers, though, still remain ugly and heavy.  They do, though, work well against falls, as I have dropped my phone countless times and the Otter Box cases have always done a great job protecting the phone from falls.The Speck cases, depending on which one you get, can also be good.  I wouldn't let my car run over my phone with a Speck case, but I haven't needed that kind of protection yet.  The Speck cases tend to be less bulky than the Otter Box cases and much better looking.Now we get to the LifeProof case.  First off, I couldn't believe a case could cost--or should ever cost--70+ dollars until I tried this case.  It is very sleek and a nice neutral color, so I won't get tired of it.  It is much easier to put on and take off than the Otter Box cases.  Also, the screen protector can easily be cleaned.  I like the fact that it weighs less than my Otter Box cases but still provides the same level of protection.  In particular, I like the waterproof feature.  I have no intention of swimming with my phone but I have had phones get wet from soda and coffee spilling on them.  Moreover, I have been near a pool with my phone and my phone has been splashed.  The extra layer of protection is definitely worthwhile, especially since water damage to the phone voids any Apple warranty.I highly recommend this case and am happy to answer any questions as to why it is so great!  By the way, a little kid put the case together, so needless to say, it is not hard to assemble.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B00A6WWPAK" id="B00A6WWPAK-review136" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2013-05-05:</strong> I've read several reviews here and elsewhere that, in general, talk about how 'cheaply made' the case is.  Frankly, I don't care if it's made out of paper...as long as it does what it says it will do.  And the LifeProof Fre case for iPhone 5 does exactly what it's advertising.  I've had almost every type of case for the various iPhones I've had--Otterbox, iSkin, Vaja, the Apple 'bumper', etc.  Depending on 'what' you want your case to do, any of the aforementioned are fine.For me, I like to keep my iPhone in 'new' condition so I can either hand it down to my child or sell it when a new model is released.  That said, in the past, the main problems I've always had are: a) scratches from wear/tear on the body of the phone; and/or b) scratches on the camera lens from 2+ years of being in/out of my pocket or on top of my desk etc.No other case really "fully protects" the camera of the ones I mentioned except LifeProof (although I think Otterbox has a fully 'waterproof' one now also).  The Fre case adds very little extra bulk (unlike other cases) to the phone...making it extremely easy to still fit in my jacket or pants pocket easily.  Because the case is fully waterproof and protects the camera with actual glass over the lens/flash, the phone is very well protected.  If I'm out eating somewhere casual (BBQ, etc) and my hands are slightly dirty... no problem answering the phone etc.  When I'm done and washing my hands...I can just run the phone under the water to rinse off as well...no problems.  And because it's fully waterproof, I can take it to the beach/pool and take pictures of my kids/family without worrying out damage to the phone (or taking a separate waterproof camera).The sound quality on the external speaker is a bit 'muffled'...however, it's not completely 'unusable'.

It also wraps nicely around the entire watch which many other skins did not do.I've tried multiple skins on the Pebble from the clear protectors to similar designed skins, but this one is best.One great thing is that with many of the other skins, they did not fully wrap around the lugs. The corners would eventually snag on sweater and jacket cuffs, slowly causing it to lift with dirt. This wont happen with the slickwraps because of the full wrap around design of it.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B00G4JU0EC', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B00G4JU0EC', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B0078XKTTY</h2>    <p class="price"> $B0078XKTTY</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

So in a way it is a good thing that the glue on the back is weaker than cheap scotch tape.  This is supposed to be a little bling thing but it has exactly the opposite effect.

I do wish that there was a little tab to remove the sticker as some of my diamond stones moved a little bit but I was able to fix them. The sticker is perfectly shaped for the home button, and I am really satisfied with the item I recieved. The raised stone makes it easier to press the home button, I must say it is a welcomed addition to my phone.I have dealt with eforcity (with great results) in the past however this item took quite a while. I was provided a tracking number that could not track the package all in all it eventually came about 4-5 days after it was suppose to come. I am satisfied with the jewel sticker, have recieved countless compliments on the look ( and a few people even stated they may get an iphone so they can have one) I will most definitely order more.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0078JDVVG" id="B0078JDVVG-review29" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-10-25:</strong> I love it none of the diamonds have fell off and adds a lil oomf to my phone!

I've used this seller here on a few occassions already & have been happy with their products & cust serv.Now, onto the home button:The color is exactly as the pic shown, as well as fitting the home button perfectly. I've had it on my phone all weekend and there are no issues of the button sliding around on the phones home button itself. It dresses up my 4S and looks absolutely adorable - i LOVE it!! Now, i'm on the hunt to find this exact button in a baby pink color - i hope it will be avail on Amazon soon!!The ONLY con of using this style home button as opposed to the 'vinyl' style stickers, is if you like to put your phone face down, as i do sometimes, because the center purple crystal sits up so high, your phone will not sit flush to the surface. The button side sticks up a bit, but with such a cute looking bling i leave my phone facing up all the time to show it off now :D The only other issue is if you change to an OB defender or a LifeProof cover, you'll need to remove the crystal button obviously because the different style of those cases has its own covered home button protection built it. As long as you use a cover that allows open access to your home button you won't have a problem.Thanks Seller1on1 for a great product!</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B0078JDVVG" id="B0078JDVVG-review32" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2012-12-20:</strong> Does not stick on like it should.

The software left much to be desired, but this new thing, AMOLED screen, was amazing!  Battery life just sucked.I had a couple problems with it, but Verizon always sucked it up and just sent me a new one.  I'm not sure if I caused the issue or not, all glitches and no physical damage.  Its been thrown out my car window 3 times with no damage!  That's the magnesium frame for you, very lightwieght and inertia free, but strong.

I can now go most of a weekend on light use, not a sip of charging.Why there is nothing like it: no other phone is as compact and light, while being a full smartphone.  iPhone feels huge and cludgy next to it.

And I thought the colors would be cool.This seller got the package to me quickly, and everything was there. I tried out a few of the colors, and the trackballs move nice and smoothly. Maybe not quite as fluid as a trackball on a brand new Blackberry, that is why I took away one star. But I've had no problems so far. And they were easy to install. I've instaled trackballs before, but for someone who has never done this before, you use the included "guitar pick"-like tool they send to gently pry out the silver retaining ring, take out the old trackball, place the new trackball in the slot, and snap a new ring into place. It's realy easy and takes just a couple minutes.For the mechanically disinclined, maybe 5 minutes.This is a good replacement for a good price.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002YGYOBY" id="B002YGYOBY-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-08-06:</strong> This is way better than buying an OEM trackball, plus it looks way cooler!

My Blackberry is very heavily used and I have already gone through two trackballs and at least one of the other Blackberry devices have begun to act sluggish. Since it seems that this is going to be a regular occurrence, a set of 5 trackballs seemed like a good investment.These are decent quality and the colors are nice for variety. The included "opening tool" (looks like a guitar pick) is just about worthless for removing the silver retaining ring, so I just used a utility knife point to pop it out. Once the retaining ring is off, just pop out the old one, put in the new one, and replace the retaining ring (use the original or one of the included replacements).These are a fairly inexpensive way to self service your Blackberry. I decided to try this first before taking it to the Sprint store to fix, so likely saved a lot by doing it myself.Recommended!CFH</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B002YGYOBY" id="B002YGYOBY-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-05-16:</strong> My CrackBerry trackball suffers from greasy fingers, exposure to elements, and all kinds of crap. I'm surprised it lasted as long as it did. Actually, what did it in was my feeble attempt to clean it. I took it a part, cleaned the little magnetic bits, put it back together and managed to cram it back in place. The ball worked better but was oriented 90 degress off! Argh...Then I looked on Amazon for a replacement was was dismayed to find they were only $2-$3 a piece. After reading the reviews, I noticed that some balls are inferiors. So I ordered this five pack. If one gets clogged, I've got more!Replacing was easier with the little blue tool. It popped out the retaining ring. I replaced the trackball and tried to replace the retaining ring. The "legs" on these retaining rings are a thinner metal. It's hard to line the legs up properly. Fortunately, my original retaining ring still worked fine. I used it.My CrackBerry is now fixed and the trackback glows green!

This case is great in that it is strong and durable but also feels fairly soft to the touch. I still wouldn't go purposely dropping your phone onto concrete with this case on, but it does provide some protection if the phone falls off your desk or vibrates off the coffee table. It's easy to snap together and easy to pry off if you ever need to get at the battery. The only thing it doesn't come with is a screen protector, but you could always get one of those cheap plastic stick-on things to help with that.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001GPGVW4" id="B001GPGVW4-review2" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-08-24:</strong> I purchased the black and the pink Seidio cases for our Blackberry Curve 8330's -- they are so simple to snap on, have a really nice "rubberized feel" (despite being hard plastic) and they add a really nice heft to the phone, making it feel slightly heavier and otherwise more substantial.  Really nice looking covers, too.  As to the pink one -- don't be afraid of the color -- my wife loves the subtle pink color of the phone (as opposed to a flashy, neon-type color) and the case matches it very nicely, maintaining the subtlety of the phone.  Great cases that fit perfectly.  Also, to clarify one of the reviews I read here -- the middle bar part of the cover doesn't in any way hinder the rollerball -- it stops your finger from continuing upward a bit, which gives kind of an illusion that it is in the way.  But, after you try it a couple times, you get used to it immediately & see that it really is no problem at all.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001GPGVW4" id="B001GPGVW4-review3" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2009-06-22:</strong> I wasn't sure what kind of case I wanted for my Curve and tried a few before realizing just how great these Seidio brand cases were. I used the included Blackberry pouch for a 2 weeks while trying out different cases and also tried the Otterbox. In the end, I bought 3 of the Seidio cases in different colors I liked them so much.The rubberized material is soft, does not pick up much dust or lint and provides excellent grip overall. It's actually a hard plastic snap-on case that provides complete protection around the BB, minus the screen, keyboard, and ports. The Otterbox's cover picked up a lot of dust and lint. The Seidio has all the correct openings for the speakers, buttons, headphone jack, data/charging port, and LED. It only adds slightly more bulk to the phone while providing excellent protection against drops and scratches. The Otterbox was MUCH too bulky and the LED cut out did not align as well and so I could not see the blinking LED while the phone was laying flat. The Blackberry pouch was nice but I felt like I was going to drop it each time I tried to remove it. It was also hard to drive with because I'd either have to remove it from the case and have no protection while driving or leave it in the pouch and try to remove it when I needed to use it or view the screen.There are only few minor drawbacks to the case. First, it offers no protection for the screen. I remedied that by purchasing a screen protector from InvisibleShield. Second, there is a thin bar that runs over the Call/End buttons and trackball so scrolling up quickly is hindered. Lastly, I had to return two of these because they would not fit correctly over my BB. Of the 5 we purchased between my wife's BB and mine, we had to return 2. But once you get one that fits, it's great. Oh, it's also a little tough to remove the case but I recommend you stick your finger nail in between the top and bottom pieces at the bottom and running it from side-to-side to remove it.I have the burgundy, blue, and black cases for myself and my wife has just the black one. Perfect cases for our Blackberry Curve 8330 Verizon phones.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001GPGVW4" id="B001GPGVW4-review4" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2010-07-16:</strong> The case is well made and all openings line up with buttons, lights, speakers, etc. The case is easy to put together but slightly annoying to take apart if you need to access the inside of your phone. Contrary to some reviews, the case does not get in the way of scrolling with the trackball. I've managed to drop my blackberry with it once already and the case actually came apart...the front half remained attached to the phone. This is probably less likely to happen if you don't take the case apart as frequently as I have. Overall, I think this is the best case for the curve in  terms of fit/alignment and look & feel.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>4</strong></p><hr></div><div class="review-container" data-product-id="B001GPGVW4" id="B001GPGVW4-review5" style="display: none;"><p class="review"><strong>2011-08-09:</strong> The case was shipped quickly and works as expected. I bought the case because it was cheap and a hard case instead of a soft 'gel' type. I am usually an Otterbox customer, but buying an Otterbox would make the case more expensive than the phone that I am only using for a few months.I'd do business with the seller again, the case works as it should. There isn't much to say about this case, just snap it together.</p><p class="rating">Rating: <strong>5</strong></p><hr></div></div></div><div class="product__buttons" style="text-align: center;"><button onclick="showPreviousReview('B001GPGVW4', 1)">Previous Review</button><button onclick="showNextReview('B001GPGVW4', 1)">Next Review</button></div></div></li><li class="product">  <div class="product__wrapper">  <div class="product__content">    <h2>B007WG0D1Q</h2>    <p class="price"> $B007WG0D1Q</p>    <p>A great description that explains what this product is all about.

I knew it would take a long time because the dates they mentioned were way out, almost 3 weeks and it took just about that long, 3 weeks. Don't listen to the other reviews that make it sound like you'll get your item immediately.This case is high enough quality and so unique, inexpensive, and cute, that I felt it was worth the premium wait time to get it. You know what they say in life, good things come to those who wait. Well, this one is good and it was worth the wait. I'm hoping they have the same thing for the 5th gen iPod Touch.This case actually adds functionality to iPod Touch. I always had trouble hitting the Vol Up and Down buttons. With this case, it's much easier. It's also much easier to hold this case than the iPod Touch by itself because it is so sleek and slippery.
